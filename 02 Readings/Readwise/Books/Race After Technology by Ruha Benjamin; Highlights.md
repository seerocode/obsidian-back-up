## Highlights
- Business as usual. #hl
    - Note: People aren’t even fazed by police racism anymore
- Like everyone who lives in a heavily policed neighborhood, I grew up with a keen sense of being watched. #hl
- other people’s safety and freedom are predicated on our containment. #hl
    - Note: Black people scapegoated as the reason for increased incarceration
- I already knew he would be profiled as a Black youth and adult, so, like most Black mothers, I had already started mentally sparring those who would try to harm my child, even before he was born. #hl
    - Note: I also had this same thought process. A name could make you a target.
- ignoring the voice in our head that says, “No way!” “Impossible!” “Not realistic!” #hl
    - Note: Be stubborn in pursuit of equity and justice!
- hope is a discipline.”1 #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- Amid so much suffering and injustice, we cannot resign ourselves to this reality we have inherited. #hl
    - Note: Stop being resilient
- What’s in a name? Your family story, your religion, your nationality, your gender identity, your race and ethnicity? What assumptions do you think people make about you on the basis of your name? What about your nicknames – are they chosen or imposed? From intimate patterns in dating and romance to large-scale employment trends, our names can open and shut doors. #hl
    - Note: Economics of names
- the presumed blandness of White American culture is a crucial part of our national narrative. #hl
- names have power by virtue of their perceived neutrality #hl
- They trigger stories about what kind of person is behind the name – their personality and potential, where they come from but also where they should go. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Names automatically create an idea of who this person may be. The conclusion to the “Everyday Coding” section of names.
- spurious correlations, reinforced by institutional inequities, and polluted by confirmation bias.”9 #hl
- boys lined up for police pat-downs #hl
    - Note: Author’s personal connection to racism by police
- Now, in the age of big data, many of us continue to be monitored and measured, but without the audible rumble of helicopters to which we can point. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- names are racially coded #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- Depending on one’s name, one is more likely to be detained by state actors in the name of “public safety.” #hl
- Together, we will work to decode the powerful assumptions and values embedded in the material and digital architecture of our world #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: What the author aim’s to accomplish with the reader
- more just and equitable approach to tech #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- reimagine what is possible #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Author urges audience to re-imagine structures to make equity and justice possible
- names reflect much longer histories of conflict and assimilation and signal fierce political struggles #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- a symptom of the chronic anti-Blackness that pervades even attempts to “celebrate difference.” #hl
- Not only does this this reek of classism, but it also harbors a willful disregard for the fact that everyone’s names were at one point made up!3 #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: The hypocrisy of pointing out uniquely spelled names as uneducated or below someone when everyone’s name was made up.
- Invisibility, with regard to Whiteness, offers immunity. To be unmarked by race allows you to reap the benefits but escape responsibility for your role in an unjust system. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Woooooh!!! To be invisible is to be free and unaccountable.
- A “normal” name is just one of many tools that reinforce racial invisibility. #hl
- some people, by virtue of their social position, are given more license to experiment with unique names. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Like celebrities naming their kids Apple or North.
- In a classic study of how names impact people’s experience on the job market, researchers show that, all other things being equal, job seekers with White-sounding first names received 50 percent more callbacks from employers than job seekers with Black-sounding names.5 #hl
    - Note: Racism in names backed up by data. Setting up the history of racial coding of names.
- Yet, rather than challenging or overcoming the cycles of inequity, technical fixes too often reinforce and even deepen the status quo. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- They found that the algorithm associated White-sounding names with “pleasant” words and Black-sounding names with “unpleasant” ones.7 #hl-blue 
    - See also: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Was the algorithm assumed to be better at mitigating bias than humans? Was this the fix? Seems like they were ignorant to the historical data issue. Need to look into this further as this doesn’t really back up their point that well as it is written.
- the New Jim Code”: the employment of new technologies that reflect and reproduce existing inequities but that are promoted and perceived as more objective or progressive than the discriminatory systems of a previous era.8 #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Benjamin’s introduction of this term — may be repeated throughout the book
- Racial codes are born from the goal of, and facilitate, social control. #hl
- once something or someone is coded, this can be hard to change. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Essentially, once a target, always a target.
- Codes, in short, operate within powerful systems of meaning that render some things visible, others invisible, and create a vast array of distortions and dangers. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- Race after Technology aims to cut through industry hype to offer a field guide into the world of biased bots, altruistic algorithms, and their many coded cousins. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Aims of the book
- the road to inequity is paved with technical fixes. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Benjamin seems to be alluding to tech not always being the right answer or the answer at all.
- argue that tech fixes often hide, speed up, and even deepen discrimination, while appearing to be neutral or benevolent when compared to the racism of a previous era #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: What the author’s argument is
- discriminatory designs – some that explicitly work to amplify hierarchies, many that ignore and thus replicate social divisions, and a number that aim to fix racial bias but end up doing the opposite. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: The three compositions of the new Jim Code
- Racial knowledge that had been dominated by anecdotal, hereditarian, and pseudo-biological theories of race would gradually be transformed by new social scientific theories of race and society and new tools of analysis, namely racial statistics and social surveys. Out of the new methods and data sources, black criminality would emerge, alongside disease and intelligence, as a fundamental measure of black inferiority.13 #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- a shift from explicit racialization to a colorblind ideology #hl
- “Criminal,” in this era, is code for Black, but also for poor, immigrant, second-class, disposable, unwanted, detritus. #hl
- These tech advances are sold as morally superior because they purport to rise above human bias, even though they could not exist without data produced through histories of exclusion and discrimination #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: The bias is in the data!
- technology “sees” racial difference, and this range of vision can involve seemingly positive affirmations or celebrations of presumed cultural differences #hl
- the humans who create the algorithms are hidden from view #hl
#### Move Slower …
- yet we are expected to pay no attention to the man behind the screen.20 #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- “[t]he datasets and models used in these systems are not objective representations of reality. They are the culmination of particular tools, people, and power structures that foreground one way of seeing or judging over another.”21 #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- digital caste system #hl
- Racism thus becomes doubled – magnified and buried under layers of digital denial #hl
- For this reason, we should consider how private industry choices are in fact public policy decisions. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Industry choices are political!!
- So “political values” here is less about party affiliation or what people believe in the abstract and more to do with how the decisions of tech entrepreneurs impact questions of power, ethics, equity, and sociality. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- If someone is marked “risky” in one arena, that stigma follows him around much more efficiently, streamlining marginalization #hl
- (55 percent, up from 45 percent) wants more regulation of the tech industry, saying that it does more to hurt democracy and free speech than help.29 #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- in my view, that many tech insiders choose a more judicious approach to tech when it comes to raising their own kids.35 #hl
- Those afforded the luxury of opting out are concerned with tech addiction #hl
- Now I’m worried that too many people are listening.”39 #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- For the rest of us, nanny contracts and Waldorf tuition are not an option, which is why the notion of a personal right to refuse privately is not a tenable solution.40 #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- In fact these students have a lot to teach us about refusing tech fixes for complex social problems that come packaged in catchphrases like “personalized learning.” #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Refusal to accept techno-solutions to complex problems.
- Coded inequity, in short, can be met with collective defiance, with resisting the allure of (depersonalized) personalization and asserting, in this case, the sociality of learning. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: We can push back on the tech that harms us.
- Move slower and empower people. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Yess!!!! #ideas
#### Tailoring: Targeting
- In this way, this book challenges us to question not only the technologies we are sold, but also the ones we manufacture ourselves. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- White studies programs? White student unions? No longer content with the power of invisibility, a vocal subset of the population wants to be recognized and celebrated as White – #hl
    - Note: The all lives matter bullshit.
- The dominant shift toward multiculturalism has been marked by a move away from one-size-fits-all mass marketing toward ethnically tailored niches that capitalize on calls for diversity. #hl
    - Note: Targeted advertising
- so long as algorithms become more tailored, the public will be given the illusion of progress.45 #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Tailoring of algorithms gives the illusion of progress
- hey use prior viewing and search histories as proxies that help them predict who will be attracted to differently cast movie posters #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Inference making to targeted at “diversity”
- Who needs to bother with race or sex disparities in the workplace, when companies can capitalize on stereotypical differences between groups? #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- The company BIC came out with a line of “BICs For Her” pens that were not only pink, small, and bejeweled, but priced higher than the non-gendered ones. #hl
    - Note: Pink tax
- a serious downside when tailoring morphs into targeting and stereotypical containment. #hl
- decades of scholarship on the social fabrication of group identity #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- This shows how multicultural representation, marketed as an individualistic and fun experience, can quickly turn into criminalizing misrepresentation. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Targeting to your face with FRT can be used for surveillance as well.
- Ethnicity Recognition #hl
    - Note: FOR WHAT FUCKING REASON IS THIS USEFUL OTHER THAN POLICING?
#### Why Now?
- coded inequity makes it easier and faster to produce racist outcomes. Notice that I said outcomes and not beliefs, because it is important for us to assess how technology can reinforce bias by what it does, regardless of marketing or intention. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Taking a consequentialist approach to coded inequity #ideas
- design of such platforms enable the “gamification of hate” by placing the burden on individual users to report harassers #hl
- This is a business model in which more traffic equals more profit, even if that traffic involves violently crashing into other users #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: The messier, the better to bring users to the yard.
- So, while Black people in the abstract enjoy greater freedom of movement, in practice many are immobilized by an elaborate penal system. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- Not only those who are convicted, but entire families and communities are stigmatized and penalized by association – they carry a badge of dishonor with widespread consequences, such as restrictions on where people can live, work, and move around.57 #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- It offers a collective ritual, which acknowledges and exposes the everyday insults and dangers that are an ongoing part of Black life #hl-red 
    - See also: [[pink]] 
    - Note: However, dragging also gets conflated with “cancel culture”, now making real aggressions appear congruent with maximum hate for minimal reason.
- dragging may obscure how the New Jim Code operates behind the scenes. #hl-blue 
    - See also: [[blue]] 
    - Note: Does dragging here also mean cancel culture?
- hypervisibility of Black celebrities, athletes, and politicians can mask the widespread disenfranchisement of Black communities through de facto segregation and the punishment apparatus. How can a society filled with millions of people cheering for LeBron, singing along to Beyoncé, tuning in to Oprah, and pining for the presidency of Obama be … racist? #hl
- “Black faces in high places” is not an aberration but a key feature of a society structured by White supremacy.58 #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- Black celebrities are sometimes recruited to be the (Black) face of technologies that have the potential to deepen racial inequities. #hl
    - Note: Nod to the commodification of “Black excellence” as progress and absence of racism.
- “What about African American English?” To this his boss responded: “Well, Apple products are for the premium market.” #hl
    - Note: Speech recognition systems systemically exclude AAVE
- It is one thing to capitalize on the coolness of a Black artist to sell (overpriced) products and quite another to engage the cultural specificity of Black people enough to enhance the underlying design of a widely used technology. #hl
- that there is no way to create something without some intention and intended user in mind #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- having a more diverse team is an inadequate solution to discriminatory design practices that grow out of the interplay of racism and capitalism #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Having diversity isn’t enough
- The “blandness” of Whiteness that some of my students brought up when discussing their names is treated by programmers as normal, universal, and appealing. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- Finally, the New Jim Code is part of a broader push toward privatization where efforts to cut costs and maximize profits, often at the expense of other human needs, is a guiding rationale for public and private sectors alike.62 #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: The bottom line is the right line
- We are talking about a redefinition of human identity, autonomy, core constitutional rights, and democratic principles more broadly.64 #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- She posits that there are different “genres” of humanity that include “full humans, not-quite humans, and nonhumans,”65 #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
    - Note: Predicated on anti-blackness
- because in many ways Black people already live in the future.68 #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- An #AllLivesMatter approach to technology is not only false inclusion but also poor planning, especially by those who fancy themselves as futurists. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: All lives don’t matter until all lives are equal
- But posthumanist visions assume that we have all had a chance to be human. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- immortality #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Who the hell wants to be oppressed for a lifetime?
- But there is a slippery slope between effective marketing and efficient racism. The same sort of algorithmic filtering that ushers more ethnically tailored representations into my feed can also redirect real estate ads away from people “like me.” #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
- coded inequity makes discrimination easier, faster, and even harder to challenge, because there is not just a racist boss, banker, or shopkeeper to report. Instead, the public must hold accountable the very platforms and programmers that legally and often invisibly facilitate the New Jim Code, even as we reckon with our desire for more “diversity and inclusion” online and offline. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: MAJOR KEY RIGHT HERE
- discriminatory practices are becoming more deeply embedded within the sociotechnical infrastructure of everyday life. #hl
- the visibility of successful non-White individuals in almost every social arena can obscure the reality of the systemic bias that still affects many people #hl
    - Note: Just because we appear to be more prosperous, doesn’t mean we are!
#### The Anti-Black Box
## New highlights added [[2023-03-06]] at 1:30 AM
- the road to inequity is paved with technical fixes. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Benjamin seems to be alluding to tech not always being the right answer or the answer at all.
#### Move Slower …
- so long as algorithms become more tailored, the public will be given the illusion of progress.45 #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: Tailoring of algorithms gives the illusion of progress
- Race after Technology integrates the tools of science and technology studies (STS) and critical race studies to examine coded inequity and our contemporary racial landscape. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: What the book does
- race critical code studies #hl
- “Black box” is a metaphor commonly used in STS to describe how the social production of science and technology is hidden from view #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- The Black Box Society, legal scholar Frank Pasquale (2014) #hl-green 
    - See also: [[green]] 
- inheres #hl
- In practice, however, people living in urban centers would not qualify #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: If Black people not in rural areas live close to wealthy areas, it would pull down the unemployment rate even though by race, the unemployment rate might be higher.
- Public policy, then, like popular discourse, is filled with racial coding. Rural :: White and urban :: Black; so, without ever making race explicit, state lawmakers are able to carve out an exception for their White constituents. #hl-purple 
    - See also: [[purple]] 
    - Note: How coded inequity hides in public policy
- race-conscious #hl
    - Note: Be race-conscious, not race blind!
- reinforce racist norms and structures without explicitly invoking race #hl
    - Note: The use of proxies for coded inequity
#### Race as Technology
