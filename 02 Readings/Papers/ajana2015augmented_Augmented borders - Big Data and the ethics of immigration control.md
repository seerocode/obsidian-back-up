What's the incentive? It's protected data.

### 🟨 Note (modified: 2023-03-15#13:51:22)
There’s no way to “start” over anymore because everyone has your data

Global data sharing as problematic as it lacks nuance

There is an assumption that this data won’t change

These assumptions assume a perfect model of a risky person based on data they have but what about the data they don’t have? That can absolutely be exploited by people.
