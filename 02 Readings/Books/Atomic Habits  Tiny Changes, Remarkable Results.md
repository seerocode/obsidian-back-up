## Highlights
there are many ways to automate good habits and eliminate bad ones. Typically, they involve putting technology to work for you. Technology can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and simple. It is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.

---
successful companies design their products to automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible.

---
A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut his clothes away so he could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment device.*

---
Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. 

---
Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.

---
Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.

---
Just as one coin won’t make you rich, one positive change like meditating for one minute or reading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable difference.

---
Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.

---
Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain conscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to refine and improve. It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill—right when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming comfortable—that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency.

---
The habit stacking formula is:
			“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

---
Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems. 

---
It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.

---
As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you:
			
				What feels like fun to me, but work to others? 

---
The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it.

---
If you don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll see you as untrustworthy or lazy. Suddenly, you are not only failing to uphold your promises to yourself, but also failing to uphold your promises to others.

---
Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe.

---
Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday.

---
The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. This approach allows you to combine the habit-stacking method mentioned in Chapter 5 with habit tracking.

---
The key is to direct your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability.

---
Take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns.

In this way, habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence.

---
When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”

---
The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.

---
When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle. Lose that one thing and you lose yourself.

---
For example, when deciding where to practice a new habit, it is best to choose a place that is already along the path of your daily routine. 

---
Similarly, one study found that the higher your best friend’s IQ at age eleven or twelve, the higher your IQ would be at age fifteen, even after controlling for natural levels of intelligence. 

---
As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong.

---
You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your desired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy” to “very hard.” For instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K is hard. Walking ten thousand steps is moderately difficult. Walking ten minutes is easy. And putting on your running shoes is very easy. Your goal might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is to put on your running shoes. That’s how you follow the Two-Minute Rule.

---
It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”

---
Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself:
			
				
					How can I make it obvious?
				
				
					How can I make it attractive?
				
				
					How can I make it easy?
				
				
					How can I make it satisfying?

---
You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.

---
At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.

---
What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. 

---
Everyone said handwashing was important, but few people made a habit out of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The problem was consistency.

In interviews, the sisters talk about their childhood as entertaining rather than grueling.

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

---
First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated.

---
when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.

---
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

---
So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.

---
The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. 

---
My wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her packing list. “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got my husband.”

---
Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in.

s required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak performance. 

---
The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.

---
When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. 

---
Similarly, if your reward for exercising is eating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re casting votes for conflicting identities, and it ends up being a wash.

---
The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes.
			
				
					“I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally tough and loves a physical challenge.”
				
				
					“I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who is disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.”
				
				
					“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and creates things.”

---
If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good at his job.

---
My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:
			
				
					What are the core values that drive my life and work?
				
				
					How am I living and working with integrity right now?
				
				
					How can I set a higher standard in the future?

---
In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.

---
But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure.

---
Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.

---
Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.

---
 If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. 

---
The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.

Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more

---
In modern society, many of the choices you make today will not benefit you immediately. If you do a good job at work, you’ll get a paycheck in a few weeks.

---
Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.

Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle.

In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.

Laws and regulations are an example of how government can change our habits by creating a social contract.

When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily.

---
Each December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more.* Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three questions:
			
				
					What went well this year?
				
				
					What didn’t go so well this year?
				
				
					What did I learn?
				
			
			Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity Report.

---
Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.

---
Furthermore, it’s not always about what happens during the workout. It’s about being the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. 

---
When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood. 

---
They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability. 

---
You don’t have to apologize for these differences or feel guilty about them, but you do have to work with them. A person who scores lower on conscientiousness, for example, will be less likely to be orderly by nature and may need to rely more heavily on environment design to stick with good habits. 

---
The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.

---
Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said.

---
If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. 

---
Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. 

---
The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people. When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? 

---
The purpose of resetting each room is not simply to clean up after the last action, but to prepare for the next action.

---
And as we are about to see, whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find.

---
True behavior change is identity change. 

---
Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. However, you can associate it with freedom rather than limitation if you realize one simple truth: living below your current means increases your future means. The money you save this month increases your purchasing power next month.

---
What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path.

---
Being curious is better than being smart. Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act. It is desire, not intelligence, that prompts behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it.”

One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list of your current habits.

The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.

How to Create a Good Habit

---
This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.

---
When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.

---
Behaviors are effortless here.
						
						
							Behaviors are difficult here.
						
					
					
						
							Obvious
						
						
							Invisible
						
					
					
						
							Attractive
						
						
							Unattractive
						
					
					
						
							Easy
						
						
							Hard
						
					
					
						
							Satisfying
						
						
							Unsatisfying
						
					
				
			
			You want to push your good habits toward the left side of the spectrum by making them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. Meanwhile, you want to cluster your bad habits toward the right side by making them invisible, unattractive, hard, and unsatisfying.

---
This is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no permanent solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the next bottleneck. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying. 

---
With a big enough why you can overcome any how. 

---
Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible. I’m often surprised by how effective simple changes like these can be. Remove a single cue and the entire habit often fades away.

---
Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. 

---
Instead, maybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury and a vote toward taking care of your body. Now the short-term reward is aligned with your long-term vision of being a healthy person.

If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible.

The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”

Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity.

---
Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have created for them.

Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.

You don’t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.

Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.

---
These onetime actions are a straightforward way to employ the 3rd Law of Behavior Change. They make it easier to sleep well, eat healthy, be productive, save money, and generally live better.

---
Choose the habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.

---
Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. 

---
Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out. 

---
The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. 

---
To approach a situation from a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your response on the data rather than the emotion.

---
If you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor, create one. 

---
The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act. The brilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically impossible. Rather than trying to change the employees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.

---
When you spend your whole life defining yourself in one way and that disappears, who are you now?

---
In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy.

---
You get what you repeat.

This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law.

Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.

---
One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul Graham, “keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting

---
The key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on it.

---
 If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it.

---
Neurologists have discovered that when emotions and feelings are impaired, we actually lose the ability to make decisions. We have no signal of what to pursue and what to avoid. As the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.”

---
We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. 

---
What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away.

Progress requires unlearning.

---
I’m smart if you ask me about habits and human behavior; not so much when it comes to knitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar chords. Competence is highly dependent on context.

---
There have been a lot of days I’ve felt like relaxing, but I’ve never regretted showing up and working on something that was important to me.

---
When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.

---
This is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-quick or weight-loss scheme. New plans offer hope because we don’t have any experiences to ground our expectations.

---
THE GOLDILOCKS RULE

---
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. 

---
know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong.*

---
There’s a strong genetic component to how obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how proactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how captivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences like attending a concert.

---
Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.

---
Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it.

---
Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.

---
If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating.

---
Create a separate space for work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.”

---
Becoming an Early Riser

---
Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.

---
If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds.

---
There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits.

---
Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present. However, we can do even better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.

---
But when they persist for years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.

---
Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature.

---
Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. 

---
Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits.

---
HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT

---
Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not the gym.

---
Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. 

---
The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

---
scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.
			
				
					Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other.
				
				
					Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous.
				
				
					Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).
				
				
					Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached.
				
				
					Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.
				
			
			

---
You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.

---
habits form based on frequency, not time.

---
But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and interesting, encouraging you to eat more.

---
The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run.

---
And this is why, if you want to be truly great, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.

---
When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly.

---
If your wants outpace your likes, you’ll always be unsatisfied. You’re perpetually putting more weight on the problem than the solution.
			Happiness is relative. 

---
The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’s in a small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the effort.

---
The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity.

---
We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:
			
				
					The close.
				
				
					The many.
				
				
					The powerful.
				
			
			Each group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior Change and make our habits more attractive.

---
But this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.

---
You’re focused on becoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking the smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be.

---
These onetime choices require a little bit of effort up front but create increasing value over time. 

---
The less energy you spend on trivial choices, the more you can spend it on what really matters.

---
The way to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way every time.”

---
Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. 

---
If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment.

---
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

---
As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”

---
Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.

---
Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.

---
Start there and work backward from the results you want to the type of person who could get those results.

---
It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.

---
This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits.

---
never miss twice.

---
We care about the opinions of those around us because it helps if others like us. This is precisely why getting an accountability partner or signing a habit contract can work so well.

---
When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.

---
Even if you’re not the most naturally gifted, you can often win by being the best in a very narrow category.

---
The point is to master the habit of showing up

---
However, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite levels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You can’t repeat the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice.
			Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

---
We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking.

---
They make you think that you have to choose between building habits and attaining freedom. In reality, the two complement each other.

---
shape your exercise habit around your interests.

---
It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort,

---
Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done.

---
Your options are constrained by what’s available.

---
For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movement.

---
The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.

---
Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you.
			A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.

---
Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior.

---
To create your own, make a list of your daily habits.

---
quality of our habits

---
see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior change but as habit adoption

---
The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence:
			I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

---
If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, why are you are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high.

---
The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it.

---
Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you. 

---
How to Break a Bad Habit

---
When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.

---
Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.

---
When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better

---
Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.

---
Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is:
			“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”

---
If you’re going to rely on punishment to change behavior, then the strength of the punishment must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct. To be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action. 

---
Similarly, when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort. (This is one reason tidying up can feel so good: we are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the cognitive load our environment places on us.)

---
The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. 

---
If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.

---
but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.

---
