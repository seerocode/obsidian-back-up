## Highlights
Instead of painting solid blocks of colour on all the walls in a room, keep them to a feature wall or a half-height line of colour instead. Diagonal blocks can create a more dynamic feel by stimulating the eyes and mind to bring a sense of energy to a space.

---
Hang photographs and artwork on walls of natural landscapes that suit the mood of the room.

---
a lively seascape might better suit a room where you want to feel invigorated.

---
Heavy use of dark colours can be dominating, so consider applying them in spaces you do not occupy for long periods of the day. An ideal location would be a hallway’s half-height wall panelling, or a porch’s floor tiling. These will make a bold statement upon entering the home, but remember that you don’t have to paint every wall in the same colour. Instead, add layers and break up your spaces with splashes of dark colour.

---
Place patterns where you might find them in nature, for example water underfoot.

In the northern hemisphere, north-facing rooms don’t usually get warm, direct light, so warm tones will feel more welcoming. An east-facing room will get the morning light, but using warmer tones will ensure it’s inviting for the rest of the day. A south-facing room can take cooler colours, because the light in here will often be warmer for the whole day.
All colours can have a warm or cool undertone. You can choose whatever colour you like – just opt for a warmer or a cooler undertone depending on the light in the space.
Colours will change depending on the time of day, and under natural or artificial light. Put a colour sample on a sheet of paper or a fabric swatch in place for 24 hours before deciding.
