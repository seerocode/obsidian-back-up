## Highlights
Look for performance fabrics: Whether it’s Sunbrella’s interior line or other performance fabrics offered from your favorite retailers

---
If you choose B (light and airy) or C (calming and cozy), consider light neutrals or pastels, and bring in lush textures to create a cozy or calming feeling. For people who chose light and airy, we’ve also seen blue and green accents be popular, in particular if you like your space to have a beachy or coastal vibe.

---
How do you keep the room from looking completely boring? The key is to think about using other elements in the space to create a pulled-together look. You can add pops of color, play up textures, and think about metallic elements to finish off a neutral space.

---
However, if you want to really sink into a sofa, consider a deeper seat—that is at least 24 to 33 inches deep.

---
Underinvesting in lighting, and not thinking about how to light your living room, can really get in the way of creating a room that feels welcoming and cohesive.

---
PRO TIP: The warmth of lighting is measured in something called Kelvin colors. I’m particularly partial to a 2700K or 3000K light bulb, which gives everything a soft white glow, without being too yellow.

---
We have light sofas all over our house, and we used Ultraguard, so when Carter forgets to take off his shoes after a romp outside, and plops on the couch, we can wipe the residue right off.

---
Once you’ve selected your white base, start to layer on other tones and textures. A really well-done neutral room looks breathtaking, not boring, and so varying your shades is very important. Don’t go all beige, trust us, that doesn’t always end well, and you’ll end up with a room that vaguely reminds you of tapioca pudding (yuck). Instead, bring in different tones of color—creams, whites, and beiges—to create subtle variation for the eye and bring a sumptuous feel to the room.

---
However, in my basement and in some of the bedrooms that don’t get as much light or are northern facing, I went with Benjamin Moore’s White Dove. 

---
Ideally in your living room (presuming it’s not huge or tiny) you’ll have:
			
				
					Three to five overhead or taller lights that are dimmable.
				
				
					Two to four table or floor lights. Consider adding one to two lights per 250 square feet.

---
So even if you have recessed overhead lights, think about a mix of table lamps and floor lamps to give you more control over the atmosphere of the room and a layered lighting look.

---
Think about a chunky knit throw, or a textured flokati or shag rug, and mix tones of wood to bring warmth and layers to your neutral living room.

---
My personal favorite, for a classic style that combines easy maintenance and style, are bistro chairs that are in a rattan or woven plastic; they are easy to wipe down but provide a timeless look. (Check out the Riviera chair at Serena & Lily, but you can find more affordable options at Wayfair.) 

---
I like to follow the classic 60-30-10 design rule for incorporating colors. Pick a color that you love to be the dominant color in your room, and then weave in a little bit of other colors to create contrast and interest. The ratio should be something like 60 percent in your dominant color, 30 percent of the secondary color, and then a sparingly used accent color in 10 percent of the room. Use the color wheel and color theory to pick two to four additional accent colors. Love blue and want to use it as the dominant color in your office? Think about persimmon (complementary) or green (adjacent) as accent colors. Or just go with different shades and textures of blue for a monochromatic look.

Rugs sit on the floor, you walk all over them all day, and thankfully, you can find some bargains on the market.

---
If you have a dining room, I suggest getting a little more creative with the design. The separate dining room is where we see people bringing in an interesting wallpaper or hanging dramatic chandeliers and art. Particularly if you are lucky enough to have a separate formal dining area that is separated from the rest of your house, I love to bring the drama, and differentiate the space from other living areas. Doing so will make the special occasions that merit the use of your dining room feel much more inspired, and stand out from your every day living spaces.

---
Neutrals will help your space feel calm, collected, and organic. The best part is that neutrals are incredibly versatile; you can use them in a variety of ways, but we most often use them to convey a relaxing and airy feeling.

---
There are a couple ways you can go with this color scheme. You can create something bold and high contrast, lending an air of drama and glam to a space. Alternatively, you can use black as an accent to offset the lightness of the room, which will create a more subtle look

---
This is where you’d want to save, as there are great deals online for dining chairs. However, when choosing dining chairs, consider carefully whether or not you want upholstered chairs.

---
you choose A (dramatic), try moody colors but don’t rule out black and white, which, due to the high-contrast factor, can really bring the drama.
