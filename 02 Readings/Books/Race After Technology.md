boys lined up for police pat-downs

---
Business as usual.

---
Like everyone who lives in a heavily policed neighborhood, I grew up with a keen sense of being watched.

---
Amid so much suffering and injustice, we cannot resign ourselves to this reality we have inherited.

---
Now, in the age of big data, many of us continue to be monitored and measured, but without the audible rumble of helicopters to which we can point. 

---
other people’s safety and freedom are predicated on our containment.

---
I already knew he would be profiled as a Black youth and adult, so, like most Black mothers, I had already started mentally sparring those who would try to harm my child, even before he was born. 

---
ignoring the voice in our head that says, “No way!” “Impossible!” “Not realistic!”

---
Depending on one’s name, one is more likely to be detained by state actors in the name of “public safety.”

---
names are racially coded

---
more just and equitable approach to tech

---
Together, we will work to decode the powerful assumptions and values embedded in the material and digital architecture of our world

---
some people, by virtue of their social position, are given more license to experiment with unique names.

---
What’s in a name? Your family story, your religion, your nationality, your gender identity, your race and ethnicity? What assumptions do you think people make about you on the basis of your name? What about your nicknames – are they chosen or imposed? From intimate patterns in dating and romance to large-scale employment trends, our names can open and shut doors.

---
Codes, in short, operate within powerful systems of meaning that render some things visible, others invisible, and create a vast array of distortions and dangers.

---
once something or someone is coded, this can be hard to change.

---
Not only does this this reek of classism, but it also harbors a willful disregard for the fact that everyone’s names were at one point made up!3

---
names reflect much longer histories of conflict and assimilation and signal fierce political struggles

---
spurious correlations, reinforced by institutional inequities, and polluted by confirmation bias.”9

---
Invisibility, with regard to Whiteness, offers immunity. To be unmarked by race allows you to reap the benefits but escape responsibility for your role in an unjust system. 

---
names have power by virtue of their perceived neutrality

---
a symptom of the chronic anti-Blackness that pervades even attempts to “celebrate difference.”

---
A “normal” name is just one of many tools that reinforce racial invisibility.

---
They trigger stories about what kind of person is behind the name – their personality and potential, where they come from but also where they should go.

---
the New Jim Code”: the employment of new technologies that reflect and reproduce existing inequities but that are promoted and perceived as more objective or progressive than the discriminatory systems of a previous era.8

---
Yet, rather than challenging or overcoming the cycles of inequity, technical fixes too often reinforce and even deepen the status quo. 

---
the presumed blandness of White American culture is a crucial part of our national narrative.

---
In a classic study of how names impact people’s experience on the job market, researchers show that, all other things being equal, job seekers with White-sounding first names received 50 percent more callbacks from employers than job seekers with Black-sounding names.5

---
They found that the algorithm associated White-sounding names with “pleasant” words and Black-sounding names with “unpleasant” ones.7

---
Racial codes are born from the goal of, and facilitate, social control.

---
Race after Technology aims to cut through industry hype to offer a field guide into the world of biased bots, altruistic algorithms, and their many coded cousins.

---
the road to inequity is paved with technical fixes.

---
argue that tech fixes often hide, speed up, and even deepen discrimination, while appearing to be neutral or benevolent when compared to the racism of a previous era

---
discriminatory designs – some that explicitly work to amplify hierarchies, many that ignore and thus replicate social divisions, and a number that aim to fix racial bias but end up doing the opposite.

---
Racial knowledge that had been dominated by anecdotal, hereditarian, and pseudo-biological theories of race would gradually be transformed by new social scientific theories of race and society and new tools of analysis, namely racial statistics and social surveys. Out of the new methods and data sources, black criminality would emerge, alongside disease and intelligence, as a fundamental measure of black inferiority.13

---
a shift from explicit racialization to a colorblind ideology

---
“Criminal,” in this era, is code for Black, but also for poor, immigrant, second-class, disposable, unwanted, detritus.

---
These tech advances are sold as morally superior because they purport to rise above human bias, even though they could not exist without data produced through histories of exclusion and discrimination

---
technology “sees” racial difference, and this range of vision can involve seemingly positive affirmations or celebrations of presumed cultural differences

---
the humans who create the algorithms are hidden from view

---
Move Slower …

---
yet we are expected to pay no attention to the man behind the screen.20

---
“[t]he datasets and models used in these systems are not objective representations of reality. They are the culmination of particular tools, people, and power structures that foreground one way of seeing or judging over another.”21

---
digital caste system

---
Racism thus becomes doubled – magnified and buried under layers of digital denial

---
For this reason, we should consider how private industry choices are in fact public policy decisions.

---
So “political values” here is less about party affiliation or what people believe in the abstract and more to do with how the decisions of tech entrepreneurs impact questions of power, ethics, equity, and sociality.

---
If someone is marked “risky” in one arena, that stigma follows him around much more efficiently, streamlining marginalization

---
(55 percent, up from 45 percent) wants more regulation of the tech industry, saying that it does more to hurt democracy and free speech than help.29

---
in my view, that many tech insiders choose a more judicious approach to tech when it comes to raising their own kids.35

---
Those afforded the luxury of opting out are concerned with tech addiction

---
Now I’m worried that too many people are listening.”39

---
For the rest of us, nanny contracts and Waldorf tuition are not an option, which is why the notion of a personal right to refuse privately is not a tenable solution.40

---
In fact these students have a lot to teach us about refusing tech fixes for complex social problems that come packaged in catchphrases like “personalized learning.”

---
Coded inequity, in short, can be met with collective defiance, with resisting the allure of (depersonalized) personalization and asserting, in this case, the sociality of learning.

---
Move slower and empower people.

---
Tailoring: Targeting

---
In this way, this book challenges us to question not only the technologies we are sold, but also the ones we manufacture ourselves.

---
White studies programs? White student unions? No longer content with the power of invisibility, a vocal subset of the population wants to be recognized and celebrated as White –

---
The dominant shift toward multiculturalism has been marked by a move away from one-size-fits-all mass marketing toward ethnically tailored niches that capitalize on calls for diversity.

---
so long as algorithms become more tailored, the public will be given the illusion of progress.45

---
hey use prior viewing and search histories as proxies that help them predict who will be attracted to differently cast movie posters

---
Who needs to bother with race or sex disparities in the workplace, when companies can capitalize on stereotypical differences between groups?

---
The company BIC came out with a line of “BICs For Her” pens that were not only pink, small, and bejeweled, but priced higher than the non-gendered ones.

---
a serious downside when tailoring morphs into targeting and stereotypical containment.

---
decades of scholarship on the social fabrication of group identity

---
This shows how multicultural representation, marketed as an individualistic and fun experience, can quickly turn into criminalizing misrepresentation.

---
Ethnicity Recognition

---
Why Now?

---
coded inequity makes it easier and faster to produce racist outcomes. Notice that I said outcomes and not beliefs, because it is important for us to assess how technology can reinforce bias by what it does, regardless of marketing or intention.

---
design of such platforms enable the “gamification of hate” by placing the burden on individual users to report harassers

---
This is a business model in which more traffic equals more profit, even if that traffic involves violently crashing into other users

---
So, while Black people in the abstract enjoy greater freedom of movement, in practice many are immobilized by an elaborate penal system.

---
Not only those who are convicted, but entire families and communities are stigmatized and penalized by association – they carry a badge of dishonor with widespread consequences, such as restrictions on where people can live, work, and move around.57

---
It offers a collective ritual, which acknowledges and exposes the everyday insults and dangers that are an ongoing part of Black life

---
dragging may obscure how the New Jim Code operates behind the scenes.

---
hypervisibility of Black celebrities, athletes, and politicians can mask the widespread disenfranchisement of Black communities through de facto segregation and the punishment apparatus. How can a society filled with millions of people cheering for LeBron, singing along to Beyoncé, tuning in to Oprah, and pining for the presidency of Obama be … racist?

---
“Black faces in high places” is not an aberration but a key feature of a society structured by White supremacy.58

---
Black celebrities are sometimes recruited to be the (Black) face of technologies that have the potential to deepen racial inequities.

---
“What about African American English?” To this his boss responded: “Well, Apple products are for the premium market.”

---
It is one thing to capitalize on the coolness of a Black artist to sell (overpriced) products and quite another to engage the cultural specificity of Black people enough to enhance the underlying design of a widely used technology.

---
that there is no way to create something without some intention and intended user in mind

---
having a more diverse team is an inadequate solution to discriminatory design practices that grow out of the interplay of racism and capitalism

---
The “blandness” of Whiteness that some of my students brought up when discussing their names is treated by programmers as normal, universal, and appealing.

---
Finally, the New Jim Code is part of a broader push toward privatization where efforts to cut costs and maximize profits, often at the expense of other human needs, is a guiding rationale for public and private sectors alike.62

---
We are talking about a redefinition of human identity, autonomy, core constitutional rights, and democratic principles more broadly.64

---
She posits that there are different “genres” of humanity that include “full humans, not-quite humans, and nonhumans,”65

---
because in many ways Black people already live in the future.68

---
An #AllLivesMatter approach to technology is not only false inclusion but also poor planning, especially by those who fancy themselves as futurists.

---
But posthumanist visions assume that we have all had a chance to be human.

---
immortality

---
But there is a slippery slope between effective marketing and efficient racism. The same sort of algorithmic filtering that ushers more ethnically tailored representations into my feed can also redirect real estate ads away from people “like me.”

---
coded inequity makes discrimination easier, faster, and even harder to challenge, because there is not just a racist boss, banker, or shopkeeper to report. Instead, the public must hold accountable the very platforms and programmers that legally and often invisibly facilitate the New Jim Code, even as we reckon with our desire for more “diversity and inclusion” online and offline.

---
discriminatory practices are becoming more deeply embedded within the sociotechnical infrastructure of everyday life.

---
the visibility of successful non-White individuals in almost every social arena can obscure the reality of the systemic bias that still affects many people

---
The Anti-Black Box

---
Race after Technology integrates the tools of science and technology studies (STS) and critical race studies to examine coded inequity and our contemporary racial landscape.

---

“Black box” is a metaphor commonly used in STS to describe how the social production of science and technology is hidden from view

---
In practice, however, people living in urban centers would not qualify

---
Public policy, then, like popular discourse, is filled with racial coding. Rural :: White and urban :: Black; so, without ever making race explicit, state lawmakers are able to carve out an exception for their White constituents.

Race as Technology

---
This field guide

---
explores not only how emerging technologies hide, speed up, or reinforce racism, but also how race itself is a kind of technology70 – one designed to separate, stratify, and sanctify the many forms of injustice experienced by members of racialized groups, but one that people routinely reimagine and redeploy to their own ends.

---
Human cultures also create symbolic devices that structure society.

---
Race, to be sure, is one of our most powerful tools

---
how race itself operates as a tool of vision and division with often deadly results.

---
How else could one declare “[w]e hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,” and at the same time deny these rights to a large portion of the population71

---
presumed lack of humanity, were never even eligible for those rights?72

Freedom, as the saying goes, ain’t free.

---
the Luddites were actually protesting the social costs of technological “progress” that the working class was being forced to accept. “To break the machine was in a sense to break the conversion of oneself into a machine for the accumulating wealth of another,” according to cultural theorist Imani Perry.73

---
the indispensable disposability of those whose labor enables innovation

---
This fails to account for the social costs of a technology in which global forms of racism, caste, class, sex, and gender exploitation are the nuts and bolts of development.77

---
Beyond Techno-Determinism

---
If thick description imagines itself able to amass more and more factual information in service to stories about cultural difference, “thin description” doesn’t fall into the trap of conceptualizing its task as providing complete and total knowledge … So, there are secrets you keep. That you treat very preciously. Names of research subjects you share but many more you do not. There is information veiled for the sake of story. For the sake of much more.102

---
Race critical code studies would have us look at how race and racism impact who has access to new devices, as well as how technologies are produced in the first place.

STS scholarship opens wide the “Black box” that typically conceals the inner workings of socio-technical systems, and critical race studies interrogates the inner workings of sociolegal systems.

but to pay closer attention to the surfaces themselves.

Race critical code studies, as I develop it here, is defined not just by what we study but also by how we analyze, questioning our own assumptions about what is deemed high theory versus pop culture, academic versus activist, evidence versus anecdote.
