## Highlights
Because you’re still a human being, and you still have to care for your own body, your own emotions, your relationship with your partner, with your friends, your intellectual life, your spiritual life, your hobbies . . . all these other aspects of your identity and your basic needs. 

---
In the time it takes me to tell my partner what to do, I might as well do it myself.
					
					
						Yes, more time for myself would be great, but I should really clean out the freezer.

---
Consider the cost to your partnership or marriage, in the form of exhaustion, resentment, and resignation to feeling alone and isolated in your relationship. I posted the following question on social media: When I think about who does the majority of household work and childcare in my household, I feel_______.

---
Scorekeeping with your partner and engaging in daily tit for tat

---
Why are you wasting your time doing that?

---
Having to remind your partner to do something doesn’t take that something off your list. It adds to it. And what’s more, reminding is often unfairly characterized as nagging.

---
Seth has since seen the light and no longer uses his paycheck as leverage, or as an excuse to do less at home. One reason why we’re still married, and happily.

---
I mean, he was just as responsible for the creation of these children as I was.

---
but putting dinner on the table must happen every day, consistently requiring more conception, planning, and execution hours, relative to the job of, say, rearranging where the holiday lights are stored in the garage.

---
what’s fair is not always equal and what’s equal is not always fair.

---
In my case, I reasoned that at the end of the day, my husband made more money than I did (Toxic Time Message #1: “Time is money.”).

---
when you free up time spent in an office, you quickly fill it by doing more at home, including more that isn’t necessarily kid-related.

---
Couples will only win at this game by emphasizing fairness.

---
A father who is distracted by . . . his myriad interests and obligations in the world of adult interactions is being, well, a father. A mother who does the same is failing her children.” 

---
Evelyn finally understood that having Unicorn Space is not about generating monetary worth.

---
Rule #1: All Time Is Created Equal

---
One of the most popular is “invisible work”: invisible because it may be unseen and unrecognized by our partners, and also because those of us who do it may not count or even acknowledge it as work . . . despite the fact that it costs us real time and significant mental and physical effort with no sick days or benefits.

---
It’s not a partnership if only one of you is running the show, which means making the important distinction between delegating tasks and handing off ownership of a task. Ownership belongs to the person who first off remembers to plan, then plans, and then follows through on every aspect of executing the plan and completing the task without reminders.

---
My Way or Move Out!

---
they can choose when they do them or outsource them altogether. In other words, Sure, I’ll help when I can:
			
				Landscaping and yard work
				IT and electronics
				Vehicle upkeep
				Storage
			
			

---
If fathers did the same kind of work at home that mothers have always done, women’s careers could flourish in ways we haven’t yet imagined.” 

---
TIME REFRAME: My time is worth as much as your time. Fairness is sharing the Daily Grind tasks. When I have more choice over how I use my time, I feel respected.
			

---
reminding and

---
When it comes to sharing the domestic load, we expect more from our children than from our partners. If your husband is guilty of undervaluing your time because he doesn’t know the full extent of all that you do, consider that you may be just as guilty.

Second Shift:

MARITAL MASH-UP: What’s your Fair Play personality type?

---
You are so much better at the ‘home stuff’ than me.”

---
I wasn’t interested in keeping a minute-by-minute scorecard with my husband where each night we tallied and compared how we each spent our days; I simply wanted both of us to value our time equally. 

---
making the full breadth of what I did for our family visible. You can’t value what you don’t see, right?

---
What gets measured gets managed.”

---
This time discrepancy where men’s time is guarded as a finite resource (like diamonds) and women’s time is abundant (like sand) is at its worst after kids.

---
As we began our descent, Jessica leaned into me and whispered, “I want to be that man.” So did I. And I couldn’t think of any working woman/mother/list-maker/planner who wouldn’t want to be him either. From where we sat, this man appeared to be enjoying a luxury all of the women we know couldn’t imagine: the freedom to focus on one task at a time.

---
TIME REFRAME: Hours spent researching, planning, scheduling, managing, maintaining communication and relationships, and finally handing off responsibilities to someone else and sometimes paying for “help” takes real time.

---
engaging in even more activities that “don’t pay” is an invitation for scrutiny. Others who often cast off their need for Unicorn Space were busy working moms: 

---
Seth regarded the 12 minutes it would have taken him to clean up our front lawn as more valuable than the same 12 minutes it took me, how could I ever expect him to take on more of the domestic workload? 

---
It’s not actually motherhood or kids that derail women’s careers and personal ambitions—it’s men who refuse to do their fair share,”

---
TIME REFRAME: I should not feel guilty about how I spend my time. 

---
Because Seth and I hadn’t pre-negotiated how to share in the domestic workload before Zach came along, it defaulted to me. 

---
The first rule for Fair Play is for you and your partner to recognize that all time is created equal . . . whether it results in earning a paycheck or stroking the forehead of a sick child. 

---
TIME REFRAME: It’s not all on me. It’s on us. Our home and family are both of our responsibilities.

---
which leaves us still shouldering the mental and emotional load for the “help” or the “favor” we had to ask for.

TOTAL: ________

---
That’s Conception. You add mustard to the grocery list that you create every week. You schedule when you’ll go to the store and consult your partner and anyone else helping around the house for any add-ons to the list. That’s Planning. You go to the grocery store so that mustard is restored to the fridge before your son takes a bite (of what you like to think is the best hot dog in the world, because it’s made with love—and mustard). That’s Execution.

---
Wash the dinner dishes, set out cereal for the morning, prep the coffee pot, pull meat out of the freezer, fill the dog’s water dish, let out the cat, put wet clothes in the dryer, empty the wastebasket, lock the doors, look in on the kids, write a quick note to the teacher, lay out clothes, wash and moisturize her face, and then add three more things to her To-Do list for the next day. Meanwhile, her husband turns off the TV and announces to no one in particular, “I’m going to bed.” And without doing anything else, he does.

---
A good mother spends her time in service to her family and to herself.
			

---
Juggling work and home is a grind, but if you think you’re going to gain more time by going part-time, think again. More time at home actually translates to less time.” 

---
Ellen found a specialized interior design course that she believed would spark the once passionate woman now dormant inside her. The problem? Rewind to the halcyon days before the ubiquity of social media and distance learning—the course was only offered in Milan, Italy. Still, Ellen was determined to make it happen. Charged with an “it’s on me” diligence, she arranged for her mother to come and stay at the house while she was away. She began the arduous process of hiring babysitters, dog sitters, and afterschool tutors to be on standby should additional help be required, and she created an extensive list of to-dos on a whiteboard calendar to ensure that absolutely nothing would fall through the cracks in her absence. But when she presented her husband with her plans, he reacted with outrage: How could she leave her six- and nine-year-olds? For two weeks? What if they needed her? Her job was at home. Again, Ellen’s husband reasoned that she didn’t “need” the course and definitely didn’t need the additional money from restarting her career. 

---
all mothers who receive texts that require us to rush home or return a call to educate our husbands about basic stuff they should know or be able to figure out about caring for our kids and the home. The biggest problem in our marriages, it seemed, were the small details. As I pulled into our driveway still fuming, something new occurred to me: Visibility = Value.

---
all that they were doing with their unpaid “off” time.

---
It’s not about monetary worth. I want my wife to have self-worth.

---
Mental Load:

---
You don’t work. You have more time.”

---
I don’t have time . . . so can you?

---
I needed to provide my husband with more context, in which every task that benefits our home is not only named and counted but also explicitly defined and specifically assigned.

---
TIME REFRAME: If we decide together that a household or childcare task isn’t important to our lives, we’ll let it go (after all, it’s not necessary to do everything). But if we agree that it holds value or is necessary to keep our family life moving forward, it’s not a waste of either of our time.

---
Though some men, like Gillian’s husband, were taking cards, they weren’t holding on to them. Not without reminders. And an “attaboy” for a job completed. Ahem. A reminder, in itself, takes tremendous mental effort by you. It requires knowing what needs to be done, remembering what needs to be done, and reminding someone to get it done, whereas the person being reminded gets off easy. He doesn’t have to remember a thing, nor does he worry about forgetting.

---
After 30 calls and 46 texts from our husbands and from the “substitute” women like sitters, neighbors, and mothers-in-law who’d been called in to rescue and cover for our husbands,

---
Emotional Labor:

---
If there are cards where you think you and your partner are both “holding” some aspect of the “C” and the “P,” give yourself half a card for now.

---
Sure, men are taking on more responsibility than they traditionally have in the past, but even the most well-intentioned men are still not doing their fair share at home.

---
Seth was not valuing my time equally to his.

---
the toll that an encumbered mind was taking on me. It was impacting every aspect of my life, and I wanted to take the discussion wider, beyond my own family and friends. 

---
Note the unconscious sexism embedded in that calculation: childcare costs shouldn’t be weighed against only the mother’s earnings. They’re a father’s responsibility, too.”

---
But even with my return to a paid job that took me to an office, I was still shouldering two-thirds of the work required to run a home and raise a family, a statistic I wasn’t aware of at the time but was undeniably living. I was still the she-fault parent charged with doing it all, buying the blueberries and masterminding our family’s day-to-day life while my husband—a good guy and a wonderful father—was still not much more than a “helper” rather than a collaborative partner/planner/participant in all that took place for our family.

---
should each do the things we’re best at.”

---
Anyone who can’t devote all his or her energies to paid work is barred from the best jobs and has a permanently lower lifetime income,

---
holding means you Conceive, Plan, and Execute every aspect of a domestic task card.

---
In other words, when both people completely own their sh*t, it’s not only more efficient, but there is far less nagging (huge benefit to husbands) and a significant lift in the mental load (huge benefit to wives). 

---
Consider the cost to your identity, in the form of a lost sense of your pre-parent self, and a feeling of disconnection from the passions and purpose that make you uniquely you

---
Once men recognized the amount of time it takes to, say, make a lunch (ten minutes), administer sunscreen to a crying toddler (three minutes), unload the dishwasher (nine minutes), plus bigger time sucks like being on call for night waking and soothing bad dreams (one to three hours) and filling out school applications (up to three days), they understood how their reluctance to spend their time performing these tasks led to an inevitable imbalance of time within the relationship.

CAUTION! This Is NOT a Score-Keeping Exercise

---
Once my own husband recognized that writing this book was my passion, he became this project’s biggest champion, which is kind of funny when you consider the topic and the light it sometimes casts him in.

---
I’d expected Seth to pick up dirty clothes, shoes, and Legos off the floor, and felt disappointed when he hadn’t. His three most-common responses: “You didn’t remind me,” “It’s just not something I think about,” and “Why didn’t you just ask?”

---
What I discovered in my conversations with couples is that once both individuals, and especially men, were asked to consider domestic tasks specifically in terms of the fairness of time, and isolated out their preference for or distaste of the task itself, their attitude shifted in a big way

---
Are you making time for activities and interests that elevate your own sense of worth?

Invisible Work:

In other words, his financial contributions “make” his wife and the family’s life possible. But wait a second—who is actually putting food on the table in terms of meal planning, shopping for groceries, and preparing breakfast, lunch, and dinner? Of the couples I spoke to, it’s often the woman who holds these cards and, as one woman countered, “The job of keeping our kids fed and merely alive day in and out

---
I don’t mind sharing the housework, but I don’t do it very well. We

---
I’d read somewhere—resentment grows out of perceived unfairness. 

---
Rather, if I wanted to stop scorekeeping with Seth and have him “own” some share of responsibility for all it takes to make our life happen, I had to stop sneaking around in the middle of the night, elfin-like, silently and magically making sh*t happen.

---
I still felt overworked at home and at the office. And I was a little bit (OK, a lot) pissed at my husband for behaving as though, if even unconsciously, the majority of our domestic workload was “on me.” But also I was pissed at myself.

---
In order to save us from big-time burnout, we need our partners to be more than helpers who carry out instructions that we’ve taken time and energy to think through (and then who blame us when things fall through the cracks). We need our partners to take the lead by consistently picking up a task, or “card”—week after week—and completely taking it off our mental to-do list by doing every aspect of what the card requires. 

---
CPE Break-Up (more on this later), when one person oversees Conception (creating the family meal plan) and Planning (adding those items to the grocery list) and the other handles Execution (cooking).

---
Once women recognized that for every one task on their to-do lists, they were actually performing an additional laundry list of subtasks, all hell broke loose. 

---
praising is the daily work of parenting children, not partnering with husbands.

---
I was insistent that this choice wouldn’t inconvenience my husband or interfere with my role as a mom.

---
playing for CPE requires that whoever holds a task card Conceives, Plans, and Executes the heck out of it—without reminders, half-ass efforts and excuses, or soliciting a “good job” for completion. 

---
I found no correlation between soliciting help and less resentment between couples because hiring someone to help you still takes work.

---
We’ve become ‘single married women,’” she offered, quoting a term coined by Dr. Sherry L. Blake that describes women in committed relationships who singularly bear the lioness’s share of family responsibilities.

---
If you don’t have enough time, outsource or get more help.”

---
If you don’t have enough time, get help!

---
We have different standards. Why should I have to work to your standards? That’s unfair.”

He says he wants to help, but he doesn’t want to be rushed. He wants to ‘help’ when it’s convenient for him,
