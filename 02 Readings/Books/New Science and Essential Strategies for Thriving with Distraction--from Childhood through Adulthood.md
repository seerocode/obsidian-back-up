## Highlights
Paying attention to the notes and pings is another story. How many times have we been alerted or reminded and, because we’ve fully intended to follow through, turned the alarm or alert off…only to realize hours later that our mind took off on another track and we missed the proverbial (or literal) train?

---
coupled with a tendency toward lassitude, often mistaken for laziness.

---
Uncannily accurate intuition, coupled with a tendency to overlook the obvious and ignore major data.

---
Another program worth mentioning that is useful for a wide range of issues—from spatial awareness to learning issues—is called Zing Performance.

---
energies, premonitions, and images from who knows where that lead to amazing success. Similarly

Add to this list in your own off-the-wall ways:

Dr. Hallowell takes it every day and reports that it reduces his reactivity, his tendency to get annoyed too quickly.

brain, the fMRI shows that when the TPN is turned on, the DMN is turned on as well, trying to muscle its way in and pull you into its grasp, thereby distracting you. In ADHD, therefore, the DMN competes with the TPN, which in most people it does not do.

---
Because then it wouldn’t be me who was succeeding. It would be me with the coach.

---
but because you weren’t focused in the moment, niggling doubt keeps you panicked until you can go back and check.

---
The second that we experience boredom—which you might think of as a lack of stimulation—we reflexively, instantaneously, automatically and without conscious thought seek stimulation. We don’t care what it is, we just have to address the mental emergency—the brain pain—that boredom sets off.

---
One of the ongoing findings in ADHD research is that some of the gene differences associated with ADHD are related to faulty dopamine and norepinephrine machinery, so a blast of exercise is like taking a stimulant that corrects this deficit for the moment

Kolbe Index

In our world, we recognize only two times: “now” and “not now.” We hear “We have to leave in a half hour” as “We don’t have to leave now.” “The paper is due in five days” becomes “It’s not due now,” and the five days might as well be five months. We hear “I’ll have to go to bed sometime” when someone has actually said “It’s time for bed now.” Our truncated sense of time leads to all manner of fights, failures, job losses, disappointed friends, and failed romances, but at the same time to an uncanny ability to work brilliantly under extreme pressure, as well as to be wonderfully, infuriatingly oblivious to the time pressures that stress most people to the max.

---
We can change who we are and where we’re headed

---
We like problems. We need the difficult. That’s because easy is boring. We need the stimulation of intense challenge. But as we’ve said, a challenge undertaken just for the sake of a challenge can be counterproductive at best, self-defeating at worst.

---
Incidentally, the reason that so many people are starting to look and act distracted, as if they all have ADHD or VAST, is that fewer and fewer people are spending time in the task-positive network. They are not spending enough time focusing on a single task, certainly not long enough to dig a deep enough hole or write an email longer than a sentence or two or do more than look at an egg, let alone fry one. Unfortunately, the TPN is akin to a muscle that atrophies when not used. So as we mentally flit around, the TPN weakens and our attention span shortens.

---
inability to observe oneself accurately

---
2011 Harvard study found that just eight weeks of mindfulness-based stress reduction work increased the cortical thickness in the hippocampus. This is a key area of the brain that oversees our learning, memory, and emotional regulation, all important areas to strengthen for those of us with the variable attention stimulus trait.

---
While we are all wired to feel fear and imagine disaster far more than to feel comfortable and secure (along with our five senses, the imagination is our chief evolutionary danger detector), people who have ADHD or VAST are also particularly prone to head toward gloom and doom in their minds because they have stored up in their memory banks a lifetime of moments of failure, disappointment, shame, frustration, defeat, and embarrassment. Given a moment to reflect on what’s likely to happen next, life has taught people with ADHD to imagine and expect the worst

---
endlessly envisioning and obsessing about what can go wrong with her argument, the five thousand ways her client might misbehave, the ten thousand ways she might blow it with the jury. As she knows only too well, while it is always good to develop options in case things go wrong, if you stay there too long, you can’t focus on the task at hand and work effectively toward preventing those mistakes.

---
The rear part of the DMN spins into overdrive, looking back at what she said, taking it apart, wondering what you did to deserve that. Was it really a pointed dig? Then you beat yourself up, thinking back, ruminating on what you might have said or done to provoke the comment. You take apart every imperfect thing you said or did at work, reliving the embarrassment.

The Rabbit Effect

an omnipresent itch—to create something

You have a vision. Maybe you’ve come up with a novel technology for making an unbeatable knife sharpener.

---
In lay terms, that means how you live is a determinant of whether or not you get a disease to which you are genetically predisposed. In other words, your environment is a powerful tonic—for better and for worse.

---
Frequent breaks for exercise during class, e.g., standing up, dancing, jogging in place, stretching.

---
And because we can’t turn this particular popcorn machine off, we are often unable to stop the idea generation at night; our minds never seem to rest.

---
People with attention issues tend to have acute bullshit detectors. We hate hypocrisy maybe more than any other human failing, and we can spot it a mile away. We don’t join cults.

---
told my wife that if you stuck me on a beach for a week and forced me to relax, and took away my iPhone and my pen and paper, after thirty minutes I’d start writing to-do lists and business ideas using my own blood. But that is not what makes me “happy” because such work is hard and stressful. So it’s sort of a catch-22.

---
Avoid processed foods, junk foods, any foods that contain additives, preservatives, and colorings.

---
Which is to say that ADHD is a far richer, more complicated, paradoxical, dangerous, but also potentially advantageous state of being than the oversimplified version most of the general public takes it to be or than even the detailed diagnostic criteria would have you believe.

Exercise with an emphasis on cerebellar stimulation

---
There are some supplements everyone can agree to recommend: a multivitamin; vitamin D; magnesium; B complex; vitamin C (ascorbic acid, as well as Connect!); calcium; zinc.

In addition to connection, exercise, and stress reduction—which are so important that we cover them in other chapters (see chapters 4 and 7)—there are five areas of your environment that we would have you focus on for yourself or your child: daily structure, nutrition, sleep, populate your world with positivity, and accept and find the right help.

is that these same people can hyperfocus, deliver a brilliant presentation on time, and be super-reliable when they are stimulated.

---
The explanation lay in the kindness shown to those rabbits by the lab technician who managed their group. She handled the rabbits in her care affectionately, talking to them and petting them while she fed them and cleaned their cages. She doted on them as a loving owner dotes on favorite pets. She was no mere lab tech, she was a purveyor of love. Love made the difference.

---
We’ve got an overabundance of attention, more attention than we can cope with; our constant challenge is to control it.

---
As you get older, this tends to manifest as a general dissatisfaction with ordinary life leading to a need to improve upon it, augment it, supercharge it, ratchet it up several notches. This “itch” can lead to major achievements and creations, or it can lead to addictions of all kinds as well as a host of other dangerous behaviors. Often it leads to both.

---
However, there is a knack to both that can be broken down into learnable steps. You do not have to be born with the knack. You can learn it inductively, rather than memorize it or have it conditioned into you.

self-image that is far more negative than is warranted

A strength-based model. Lily explained to Samuel that he had a race car for a brain, but with bicycle brakes. I told her it was key for him to understand that his race car brain was a great asset of which he should feel proud. He just needed to work on his brakes, so that then he could win races and become a champion.

But no ridicule or teasing, no matter how much fun they may be.

took a minute to sink in. Uncle Ron suddenly realized that he had left Gretchen at the store. When he left the parking lot, he was so focused in the front part of his DMN, planning for the future, envisioning his garden, that he didn’t connect to the back part of his DMN, the history that revealed he had a wife he adored, and the memory that they had driven to the store together.

We are also sometimes the talented executive who keeps falling short due to missed deadlines, forgotten obligations, social faux pas, and blown opportunities.

The biological fact is that, in the absence of stimulation, they can’t. Not won’t. Can’t.

If you can, I said, get a wobble board, a board with a rounded bottom so that it’s hard to balance on. Also get an inflatable exercise ball that’s big enough for him to sit on so his legs can’t touch the floor.
Stand on one leg for one minute or until he falls over.
Stand on one leg with eyes closed for one minute or until he falls over.
Take off socks and then put on socks without sitting down.
Stand on wobble board for as long as he can, up to five minutes, then do it with eyes closed.
Sit on exercise ball with feet off the floor for as long as he can, up to five minutes, then do it with eyes closed.
Put five playing cards on the floor. Standing on one leg, bend over and pick up one card at a time.
Do a low plank hold (elbows down on the ground, feet extended behind) for up to three minutes.
Learn to juggle balls, and then spend three to five minutes juggling.

A top-down, I lecture/you listen structure is not compatible with the ADHD mind.

we are the ones who offer the shirt off our back to the person who needs it, whether we know them or not. It’s why so many of us excel in sales. We can be charismatic, infectiously funny, persuasive, and just what you need if you’re feeling low.

As a guiding principle, you ought to spend the majority of your working hours at the intersection of three circles: the circle of all the things you really like to do, the circle of all the things you’re really good at doing, and the circle of things that someone will pay you to do.

Toward that end, we take a strength-based approach to treating people in our practices. As we like to say, we do not treat disabilities, we help people unwrap their gifts. More exuberantly: We help identify superpowers!

into a state of misery and despair, for no good reason whatsoever.

It improves mood and motivation, reduces anxiety, regulates emotions, and maintains focus.
From depression to anxiety as well as for ADHD and VAST symptoms, exercise is just what the doctor should order.

Non-drug Treatments for ADHD, by Richard Brown and Patricia Gerbarg

ADHD as a complex set of contradictory or paradoxical tendencies: a lack of focus combined with an ability to superfocus; a lack of direction combined with highly directed entrepreneurialism; a tendency to procrastinate combined with a knack for getting a week’s worth of work done in two hours; impulsive, wrongheaded decision making combined with inventive, out-of-the-blue problem solving; interpersonal cluelessness combined with uncanny intuition and empathy; the list goes on.

Tape random numbers on the walls around a room, or outside on trees. Call out numbers and require kids to see how quickly they can tag them. This gets their heart rates up, which in turn lights up the task-positive network (TPN), serving to strengthen the connections between the default mode network (DMN) and TPN in the process.

ADHD is telling others to watch out, there’s an ill wind brewing; or to get ready, a big opportunity is just around the corner. Like the lightning rod, the weather vane effect can’t be explained on any scientific basis we know of, but we see it in our patients, of all ages, all the time.

Many adults never discover they have ADHD until their environment dramatically changes.
