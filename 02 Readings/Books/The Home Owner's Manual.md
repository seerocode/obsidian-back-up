## Highlights
Twice a year, carefully spray lock lubricant (available at hardware stores) into all household locks. Clean the lubricant from adjacent surfaces. Also clean and straighten all keys so they easily insert into the locks. Replace worn or damaged keys so they do not break off in a lock.

A plastic bucket with all primary cleaning products and tools can be taken from room to room as needed or as scheduled.

Set up a recycling point (usually in a utility room or a garage) where unused items are placed for recycling (weekly) or donation (monthly).
