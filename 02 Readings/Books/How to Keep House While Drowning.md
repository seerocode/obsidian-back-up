## Highlights
What you say to yourself when your house is clean fuels what you say to yourself when it’s dirty. If you’re good when it’s clean, you must then be bad when it’s not.

---
So if you ever actually let yourself sit down and rest, you’re thinking, “I don’t deserve to do this. There is more to do.”

---
Chores → care tasks
Chores are obligations. Care tasks are kindness to self.

---
You are a person. You deserve to be cared for. I want your home to care for you. How do we do that? By focusing on function.

---
Let me tell you what the mess in my home means. It means I’m alive. Dirty dishes mean I’ve fed myself. Scattered hobby supplies mean I am creative. Scattered toys and mess mean I am a fun mom.

---
When everything is in place, you don’t feel like a failure; when it’s messy or untidy, you do.

---
I’m learning that when marginalized communities face racism or classism, high standards for cleanliness can be a way for a family to reassert their own dignity in the face of dehumanizing stereotypes about being lazy, unintelligent, or dirty. Loving families might insist that their home sparkle or their children’s clothes be spotless, not out of a perceived superiority, but as a way of protecting against discrimination.

---
Someone who is affected by serious mental illness or systemic oppression has a lot more standing in the way of a happy life than a simple attitude adjustment.

---
I suspect that many people doling out productivity advice focus on areas where they’re naturally gifted—areas where all they needed was a little push or a couple of tips to get themselves unstuck. 

---
That I could consider nighttime prep as a kindness to morning me changed my entire relationship with care tasks.

---
success depends not on having strong willpower, but in developing mental and emotional tools to help you experience the world differently.

---
Although it looks like a lot, there are actually only five things in any room: (1) trash, (2) dishes, (3) laundry, (4) things that have a place and are not in their place, and (5) things that do not have a place.

---
You can be a fully functioning, fully successful, happy, kind, generous adult and never be very good at cleaning your dishes in a timely manner or have an organized home.

---
You don’t exist to serve your space; your space exists to serve you.

---
But the solutions that work for them are highly dependent on not only their unique barriers but also their strengths, personality, and interests.

---
Category cleaning gives your brain multiple, quick finish lines to feel good about.

---
How you relate to care tasks—whether you are clean or dirty, messy or tidy, organized or unorganized—has absolutely no bearing on whether you are a good enough person.

---
The single mom of three, however, is experiencing very different demands and limitations on her time. For her, she needs not only effort but also childcare, money for exercise classes, and extra time and energy at the end of a day when she has worked nine hours and then spent an additional five caring for kids and cleaning house.

---
Do you feel good when your home is clean and laundry is folded? Ask yourself why. 

---
When we understand what really matters to us in terms of safety, comfort, and happiness, we can begin to let go of others’ judgments of how our spaces must look. One person may be perfectly comfortable and happy in a space that is significantly messier and less organized than another person.

---
Many self-help gurus overattribute their success to their own hard work without any regard to the physical, mental, or economic privileges they hold.

---
Once I realized I did not have to be tidy to be organized, the second half of my life began!”

---
In the end, the approach that you are motivated to do and enjoy doing is the most “efficient,” because you are actually doing it and not avoiding it.

---
Suddenly all that is really required fits on a short, finite list. I can do a few things to feel like I have cared for my needs. Then move on. If I have the time and energy to continue on and clean the whole kitchen, great! But if not, I can move on without guilt. Now my space is serving me and not the other way around.

---
The concentration it takes to keep track of every item I use and return it to its home immediately makes it difficult to enjoy the moment. 

---
Being unwell and struggling do not make you unworthy of kindness. 

---
Individual capacity is shaped by biology, psychology, and environment. Just because Susie with six kids and depression can keep an immaculate house does not mean you are morally inferior if you cannot.

---
Even when I’m by myself, I tend to wander excitedly from project to project without quite wrapping up the former one before beginning the next. This isn’t a flaw. I like spending my day this way. It’s fun and enjoyable for me. I

---
It’s rarely about who is trying harder or who is a better person but instead about individual capacity.

---
In my home, almost everything has a place, but ADHD and two small kids mean things don’t really get returned to their places very quickly. 

---
I love a calming visual as much as the next person, but it’s important to remember that not everything has to be aesthetically pleasing to be organized and not everything aesthetically pleasing is functional!

---
The same disorder or barrier does not present the same way in everyone.

---
But sometimes the “right” way of doing something creates barriers for certain executive functioning skills. Sometimes the simple reason is that the right way is not enjoyable and so it gets procrastinated. 

---
If, however, you want clean clothes, you feel your life would be better with clean clothes, and you would like to be able to do the laundry you’ve been staring at for hours but just can’t seem to make yourself do, that’s not a lack of motivation. That is a problem with task initiation.

---
Task initiation barriers usually present themselves as difficulties in transitions.

---
What I need to do here is find a way to create momentum.

---
Instead of bullying yourself into finishing a task, instead try giving yourself permission to start a task.

---
It’s stressful to try to summon up 100 percent of the momentum to do something while sitting on the couch. 

---
Anything worth doing is worth doing partially.

---
How can I move towards this task?”

---
Next time you want to do a care task, start an enjoyable task and use the wait time to start a care task.

---
Ask a friend to spend time with you while you do care tasks. You can even call them on the phone.

---
There are a few brands that sell visual timers. Time Timer and Secura are two good brands

---
It doesn’t matter if you’re “never caught up on laundry.” It only matters if everyone has clean clothes to wear when they need them.

---
Not everything has to be clean at the same time.

---
But keeping everything done isn’t the point. Keeping things functional is the point because here’s the thing: it will look like that again tomorrow only if I clean it today.

---
I tidy things up not because it’s bad that it’s messy but because it has reached the end of that cycle of functionality and I need to reset it so it can have another twenty-four hours of it serving me.

---
But using something is not the same as wasting something. 

---
Everyone finds different activities restful, but in general we’re seeking the same qualities: connecting, slowing down, and just being, rather than being productive.

---
You do not have to earn the right to rest, connect, or recreate. 

---
It might be that when you first start giving yourself full permission to rest without guilt you find yourself resting a lot. Maybe that’s what your body and mind need. 

---
Instead of relief, taking a break only brings feelings of guilt.

---
When I was going to school or working, it was never a problem. The daily ritual of standing at the vanity every morning and getting ready to leave the house coupled with the motivation that I didn’t want anyone to be grossed out by my breath made it easy. 

---
A situation where one partner can come and go on a whim and assume the other will care for the children, but the other partner has to practically file HR paperwork with their spouse three weeks ahead of time in order to leave for an afternoon is not a partnership with fair rest. Everyone deserves a window of their week when they have time autonomy.

---
Rest includes responsibilities. It is your partner’s responsibility to protect your rest time but your responsibility to actually rest. If your own perfectionism has you using your rest times to scrub baseboards, that is not your partner’s fault.

---
you are not responsible for saving the world if you are struggling to save yourself. 

---
The problem isn’t that I chose to rest instead of clean the kitchen; it’s that I told myself I was being a bad person by doing so.

---
never stop moving, feel anxious and overwhelmed, and are constantly exhausted

---
questioning in what way laundry could be functional for me.

---
It’s not about getting permission; it’s about giving respect. Free time does not automatically belong to one parent at the expense of the other.

---
Pick out a week’s worth of clothing to launder and pack everything else away in bags or Rubbermaid bins until a time when you can deal with it. Pick a day to launder your clothes, and if you feel up to it add back in a few items at a time.

---
You have a body—you are not your body. 

---
But if prioritizing a few good things that really matter to you and aiming for good enough with the rest of it lets you come out at the end of the day healthy and able to experience joy—now that’s an excellent life.

---
Remember that anything worth doing is worth doing half-assed.

---
And my bedroom feels serene and tidy because I have given the bathroom permanent permission to look like a feral raccoon lives in it. 

---
The impact that you could have on the world when you are fully functioning far outweighs the negligible negative impact that one household’s disposable plastic or extra water usage will have. 

---
So throw away what you think care tasks “should” look like and work towards a way of doing them that works for you. 

---
there is no reason to go through the extra steps of putting it in drawers.


---
My point is that having kids doesn’t make care tasks easier or harder; it just makes them different. I was messy far before I ever had kids.

---
acceptable use of plastic is always set according to what a healthy person needs to be healthy (think masks, gloves, plastic prescription bottles, kinesiology tape… even home delivery supplements that individually package your daily vitamins), but when it comes to someone with a disability using plastic, everyone wants to shame

---
The truth is that both are tired. Both want their labor appreciated. And both deserve rest. That’s right; even if you have the “easier” job, you still need rest. 

---
The goal then is to take steps that reduce harm, first to self, then to those individuals around us, then to our community.

---
Meanwhile, the partner doing the “easier” job does not have those built-in breaks.

---
Then I learned to work with my brain instead of against it. I came up with rituals that outlined exactly what I was to do in a room and exactly in what order. My Five Things Tidying Method is one such ritual. Closing duties is another.

---
Cleaning caddies and supplies for each room or floor to reduce having to walk

---
Forget about creating a routine. You have to focus on finding your rhythm.”
With routines you are either on track or not. With rhythm you can skip a beat and still get back in the groove.

---
But the moral issue is not that that partner is not contributing enough—it’s that they feel more entitled to rest than their partner and are exploiting their partner’s labor to get it.

---
How do we respond when someone criticizes the state of our home or tries to “help” us by giving advice that doesn’t really fit?

---
The best way to do something is the way it gets done.

---
try just putting a laundry basket next to the chair and putting things into the laundry basket instead. Now you can take the whole basket to the laundry room when you can and it looks a little more contained until then.

---
I want my kids to grow up to care for others and treat them fairly without being crushed by the false guilt of thinking their worth is tied to how much they can produce or contribute. 

---
It’s important to remember that your children do not have the same emotional context around mess or dirt as you.

---
So I came up with a hack for ensuring the whole list would get done.
I took that item off the list. Now the whole list gets done.

---
Once a system becomes easy and automatic you can try another little tweak to increase the function even more.

---
Floors

1. Health and Safety: I need to remove tripping hazards and prevent bugs, mold, and bacteria from spreading or growing.

---
Self-care was never meant to be a replacement for community care.

---
but the reality is there is no finish line

---
the past when I had a cleaning service, I would feel stressed out at having to pre-clean and pick up before they got there. Knowing I didn’t have to do that took so much stress away.

---
Then I sit down and watch television and hang out with my husband. It’s a true win-win situation: right now me gets to rest and future me gets to function.

---
Sometimes just having someone to keep you company while you complete tasks is helpful.

---
Change the AC filter
Clean out kitchen cabinets
Clean out the garage
Purge closet and donate old clothes
Purge and donate toys
Clean inside of refrigerator
Pack in or out seasonal clothes
Clean inside of garbage can
Clean gutters

---
When I realized it was the tiresome interruptions I hated, I compiled as many of these small restocking tasks in to one big task: Restock Day.

---
There are no good or bad foods. There are no right or wrong foods.

---
You don’t have to do better to start feeling better.

---
When that happens the priority becomes getting my kids to bed with kindness. For those days we have survival closing duties. What’s the bare minimum I need to function tomorrow?

---
Think of four to six tasks that, if they were done every week, would make that space very livable.

---
Often the difference between messy and organized is a well-placed basket. The key is to put the basket where you are already making messes.

Laundry

1. Health and Safety: I need to have clean clothes to wear.
2. Comfort: I want my clothes to look nice and for me to find what I am looking for easily.
3. Happiness: I like having an aesthetically pleasing closet
