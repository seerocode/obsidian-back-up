[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N69GRBRZ?page=2&annotation=D2Q6Y74C)“Such an approach will always be inadequate in a context that is fundamentally unjust (Fazelpour and Lipton, 2020, Green and Viljoen, 2020).” ([Davis et al., 2021, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/P44PHWWH))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N69GRBRZ?page=2&annotation=DMMQ7W24)“Algorithmic idealism begins with a base belief in equal opportunity, defining the problem of stratification as one caused by fallible human biases on the one hand, and imper- fect statistical procedures, on the other.” ([Davis et al., 2021, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/P44PHWWH))

Such proposals are consistently eluded by the fair- ness they mean to achieve.” ([Davis et al., 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/P44PHWWH))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N69GRBRZ?page=3&annotation=UHSYQZPJ)“This means doing away with fairness and instead, coursing resources to those who have been sys- tematically denied. This approach pairs the logic of Intersectionality with the praxis of reparation.” ([Davis et al., 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/P44PHWWH)) Never fairness, always reparation!

As evi- denced by the backlash against affirmative action policies and resistance to critical race curricula (Ray and Gibbons, 2021; Vought, 2020), an intentional reallocation of resources will, undoubtedly, come up against significant friction.

This is a computational mechanism that centers impact estimations that most reduce inequality in automated decision outputs. These auditing tools are intended specifically for institutional decision aids, such as those used in hiring processes, loan allocations, and admission decisions, calibrated to the par- ticular inequalities of the communities affected.

> Socially, reparation relies on a base logic that diverges from normative conceptions of fairness, opting instead for uneven resource allocations targeted at the margins. As evi- denced by the backlash against affirmative action policies and resistance to critical race curricula (Ray and Gibbons, 2021; Vought, 2020), an intentional reallocation of resources will, undoubtedly, come up against significant friction. Rectificatory tactics will be difficult to accept for those who ascribe to an image of society that is functionally meritocratic, and this baseline assumption is indeed, deep-seated. (p.
