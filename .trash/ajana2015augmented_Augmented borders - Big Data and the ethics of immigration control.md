title: Abstract
Purpose Investments in the technologies of borders and their securitisation continue to be a focal point for many governments across the globe. This paper is concerned with a particular example of such technologies, namely, “Big Data” analytics. In the past two years, the technology of Big Data has gained a remarkable popularity within a variety of sectors, ranging from business and government to scientific and research fields. While Big Data techniques are often extolled as the next frontier for innovation and productivity, they are also raising many ethical and political issues. The aim of this paper is to consider some of these issues and provide a critical reflection on the implications of using Big Data for the governance of borders. Design/methodology/approach The author draws on the example of the new Big Data solution recently developed by IBM for the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. The system, which relies on data collected from Passenger Name Records, aims to facilitate and automate mechanisms of profiling enable the identification of “high-risk” travellers. It is argued that the use of such Big Data techniques risks augmenting the function and intensity of borders. Findings The main concerns addressed here revolve around three key elements, namely, the problem of categorisation, the projective and predictive nature of Big Data techniques and their approach to the future and the implications of Big Data on understandings and practices of identity. Originality/value By exploring these issues, the paper aims to contribute to the debates on the impact of information and communications technology-based surveillance in border management.

>is this stale? is it once a criminal always criminal? RISK-SCORING AS CODING

<mark class="customZot-Blue ">[the] risk-based identity of the person who attempts to cross an international border is in this way encoded and fixed far in advance of reaching the physical border - when, for example, he leaves the electronic traces of buying an air ticket, applying for a visa, using a credit card, and so on.’</mark> ([12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=12&annotation=NJ9N6J3D))

>creating an "other"

<mark class="customZot-Blue ">classification systems are neither neutral nor objective, but are biased toward their purposes. They reflect the explicit and implicit values of their designers.</mark> ([13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=13&annotation=K8VFPPH7))

<mark class="customZot-Blue ">The use of big data can thus become an immobilising act of force that suppresses the movement of certain categories and restricts their access to spaces and services.</mark> ([13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=13&annotation=XG8SPRBG))

 
<mark class="customZot-Yellow ">For instance, a simple search on Google for popular immigrationrelated topics like “moving to Australia” or “EU asylum law” can indicate intent to move or migrate (ibid.).</mark> ([13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=13&annotation=3AX2BMJP))

  
>keyword searching as a problem

<mark class="customZot-Blue ">This in turn ends up perpetuating the dividing discourses and conceptions of “us and them”, the “ins and outs”,</mark> ([14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=14&annotation=JU22BYK6))

<mark class="customZot-Green ">‘universalistic’</mark> ([14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=14&annotation=9I9KZ6CG))

 
<mark class="customZot-Green ">humanity has for so long ‘operated through systematic technologies of inclusion/exclusion’ (Bhandar, 2004: 271) that are informed by a defective thinking of what constitutes the human in the first place.</mark> ([14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=14&annotation=LPK7HALE))

  
>what constitutes a human?

<mark class="customZot-Green ">Judith Butler (2003) argues that oftentimes it is the dominant assumptions about the human and its conflation with artificial categories such as the ‘citizen’ that threaten to leave those who are perceived as ‘others’ in a no-man’s land whereby their humanity is in danger of being left unrecognised and unacknowledged.</mark> ([14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=14&annotation=J4UWY5FA))

 
<mark class="customZot-Blue ">one that operates by unduly making assumptions and forming views about others without even ‘encountering’ them.</mark> ([17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=17&annotation=6B7GKELZ))

 
<mark class="customZot-Blue ">he subjects of big data predictions are often unaware of the content and the scale of information generated about them. They are often unable to respond to or contest the ‘categorical assumptions’ made about their behaviours and activities</mark> ([17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=17&annotation=QILUBTWY))

  
>So traveling automatically implies consent to this categorization?

<mark class="customZot-Blue ">They are left without the chance to challenge the measures and policies that affect them in fundamental ways, such as criteria of access and so on. What happens then to those who appear as hits on the various digital archives and databases? Or more importantly, ‘how a “false hit” that leads to detention or deportation can be challenged [?] As one EPIC lawyer put the problem: “these technologies are assumed to provide a complete picture of who someone is, leaving people having to dispute their own identity”’ (Amoore, 2006: 340).</mark> ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=18&annotation=CLLTJX7H))

 
<mark class="customZot-Green ">panoptic</mark> ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=18&annotation=U3AXYRJ4))

 
<mark class="customZot-Blue ">In this respect, one of the ethical challenges is certainly a matter of ‘setting boundaries around the kinds of institutional assumptions that can and cannot be made about people, particularly when important life chances and opportunities hang in the balance’ (Kerr and Earle, 2013).</mark> ([18](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=18&annotation=TUAFG33Q))

  
>This is a way to define ethics: what can we not assume about a person using this data? Separate the data from the person.

<mark class="customZot-Blue ">Such categorisations often lead to reinforcing forms of inequality and discrimination and modes of oppression that have become hallmarks of recent immigration policies.</mark> ([24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=24&annotation=JERACC4S))

  
>categorization

<mark class="customZot-Blue ">Through their preemption philosophy, big data tools enable the systematic profiling of people and the forming of assumptions about their character, behaviour, activities and risk potential without even encountering them.</mark> ([24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=24&annotation=9RSH7IJB))

  
>judging a book by its cover

<mark class="customZot-Blue ">I therefore emphasised the importance of an embodied approach to contest this presumed separation between data and their physical referent. This is crucial, especially when the identities at issue are those of vulnerable groups such as asylum seekers and refugees.</mark> ([24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4I8JFU4C?page=24&annotation=5TXQNAWI))

  
##### For instance, one benefit relates to the ways in which big data can enable migration scholars and activists to overcome the lack of accurate statistics that continue to plague the field of migration studies and research
