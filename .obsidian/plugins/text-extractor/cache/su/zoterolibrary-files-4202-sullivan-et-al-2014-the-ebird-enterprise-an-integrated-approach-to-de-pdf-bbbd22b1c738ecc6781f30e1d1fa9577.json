But citizen-science projects vary in their ability to contribute usefully for science, conservation, or public pol- icy. eBird has evolved from a basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise, taking a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of ﬁelds: population and distributions, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, com- puter scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators. The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats. \u0002 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Citizen science is gaining momentum (Irwin, 1995; Dickinson et al., 2010), but citizen-science projects vary in their ability to de- liver useful data for research and conservation. Tulloch et al. (2013) reviewed the efﬁcacy of various citizen-science approaches, and recommended a series of actions that could improve the impact and utility of citizen-science data. These included incorporating more rigorous sampling techniques into unstructured data collec- tion processes, improving data quality, broadening the data-user community, and improving communication between those using the data and those collecting it. We suggest that achieving these objectives is best accomplished by expanding the range of activi- ties routinely encompassed with the running of citizen-science projects to extend beyond data collection to include community engagement, data curation, data synthesis and analysis, pattern visualization, and delivery of results to a broad community of pos- sible stakeholders. In this paper we will illustrate this point using eBird (ebird.org; Sullivan et al., 2009) as our example. eBird has evolved from a stand-alone citizen-science project focused on collecting data, into a cooperative partnership involving several distinct user groups spanning multiple scientiﬁc domains and dozens of partner organizations, each with its own unique interests in the project’s success. eBird collects information about the distribution and abun- dance of birds, taking advantage of the enormous popularity of watching birds to create a global network of volunteers who sub- mit bird observations via the Internet to a central data repository. Through a combination of broad-based community engagement and global partnerships, the volume of data coming into eBird has increased exponentially (30–40% annually) for a decade (Fig. 1). By mid-year 2013, over 140 million observations had been submitted by 150,000 separate observers, who spent 10.5 million hours in the ﬁeld collecting data. While global in scope, the major- ity of eBird data still come from North America. Not only has input of data grown, but output of information has grown as well, fostered by collaboration among researchers from diverse scientiﬁc domains including ornithology, landscape ecology, macroecology, biogeography, computer science, statis- tics, computational sustainability, human computation, informal science education, conservation science, and public policy. Engagement in eBird across these domains creates continuous investment and feedback from a diverse community that helps shape eBird to meet the needs of a wide array of both academic and non-academic audiences. This communication is aided by eBird’s integrated project structure involving participants who collect data, researchers analyzing the data, agencies adopting policies based on the data, and land managers taking direct Fig. 1. eBird Growth.

Sullivan et al. / Biological Conservation 169 (2014) 31–40 conservation action (Fig. 2). Ultimately, these collaborations have enabled us to increase both the quantity and the quality of useful data available for analysis. Further, this broad spectrum of intellectual contributions and applications has fundamentally changed our view of the project, which we now see as a collective enterprise. 2. Increasing data quantity while improving data quality Hochachka et al. (2012) showed that maximizing the analytical value of citizen-science data requires striking the right balance be- tween data quantity and data quality. Large quantities of data are needed because the per-datum information content of citizen-sci- ence data is often low, because most projects use relatively simple protocols. However, we also need to identify minimal standards of quality, and ideally raise these standards through time. Thus, we have focused on both growing the data-collecting community en- gaged with eBird, while simultaneously improving the project’s data quality mechanisms through a variety of means. 2.1. Meeting community needs Increasing the number of participants in a project and the amount of information that each participant provides requires identifying this audience and meeting their needs. For eBird’s audi- ence of active birdwatchers, the ability to rapidly improve the technologies that we use to interact with participants is key. In 2011, we redesigned eBird’s online data entry process to improve efﬁciency and ﬂexibility. The new process allows users to enter data more quickly, but also features a ﬂexible data collection framework that promotes submission of ancillary data (e.g., breed- ing status, age and sex classes). At the same time, feedback solic- ited from participants has shaped new developments that provide valuable end-user tools and rewards. For example, partic- ipants can keep track of their personal bird lists, receive rare bird alerts, explore information on when and where to ﬁnd birds, and take part in games that appeal to competitive spirit. As a result, participants become increasingly invested in the project, thereby increasing data volume (Wood et al., 2011). We also recognize that a growing number of people are no long- er using desktop computers as their primary means of connecting to the Internet. In 2012, we partnered with a smart phone applica- tion developer to release ‘‘BirdLog’’ (birdseyebirding.com), an app that allows anyone to submit or retrieve eBird observations on mo- bile devices anywhere around the world. Currently nearly 20% of eBird data are submitted on mobile devices in the ﬁeld. Keeping participants’ bird lists updated and accurate is another critical component of eBird’s community services. As with any organismal database, detailed attention to taxonomy and nomen- clature is essential. Thus, maintaining a current, accurate, and user-friendly taxonomy is an integral part of eBird. eBird maintains its own taxonomy for use by birdwatchers that is updated annually (help.ebird.org/customer/portal/articles/1006825), keeping partic- ipants’ records current with changes in our knowledge of how many species of birds exist and where they live. Fig. 2. Data ﬂow, interdisciplinary integration, and feedback in the eBird enterprise. User communities are represented by circles; hardware, software, and infrastructure by rectangles. Starting at the bottom of the ﬁgure, eBirders enter observations either through the core eBird web site, an eBird portal, or the mobile application. All data then pass through one centralized data quality process before entering the centralized data management and cyberintrastructure. The database infrastructure provides the hub for all data storage, curation, and retrieval. Data exploration, visualization, and analysis are provided through close collaborations with the one or more domains. Four data products are created (EOD, EBD, ERD, and STEM), which are openly accessible and tracked, leading to broad scale data use. The feedback loops are key. All aspects of the eBird enterprise inform eBird development and provide feedback to the user in some way (green or blue arrows). For example, our research and analysis teams suggest best practices for data collection, and our data quality process helps participants realize when they’ve made a mistake, helping them become better birders. Our web tools are geared toward providing user reward. All of these things lead to increased engagement and data volume, which in turn creates better data products and more informed conservation outcomes.

Sullivan et al. / Biological Conservation 169 (2014) 31–40 33 2.2. A ﬂexible platform Another aspect of meeting participants’ needs is making adap- tations for speciﬁc audiences. eBird’s user interface is designed to allow a level of customization to suit a variety of potential use cases. For example, we aim to overcome language barriers to par- ticipation by making eBird available through customized ‘‘portals’’, which can be created in any non-English language and managed by partner organizations outside of the United States (e.g., aver- aves.org) (Wood et al., 2011). Speciﬁc interest groups can be engaged, such as the Young Birders Network—a portal managed and written by young people who are passionate about birds (ebir- d.org/content/ybn). This ﬂexibility ensures a high level of local expertise, promotion, and project ownership to better engage regional audiences. The data collection process can also be modiﬁed to meet spe- ciﬁc research goals. Customizing and augmenting eBird’s standard data collection protocols promotes a level of adoption that would be impossible if eBird maintained a rigid approach to data collec- tion. Importantly, in spite of different routes for the entry of infor- mation, the data coming in through each customized portal are fully integrated with the eBird database and application infrastruc- ture so that information can be shared and analyzed freely across linguistic, political, and geographic boundaries. This integrated application infrastructure ensures that enhancements in one portal are available in all other portals, providing economies of scale and access to database and application infrastructure that would other- wise be too costly for any single institution to implement. Many users of eBird are not interested in developing partner- ships and portals, but instead use eBird as an informal cyberinfra- structure for data ingestion and output supporting their work. In many cases, the individuals and groups coordinating such projects have no resources for technology support (Wiggins, 2013), and adopt the basic functionality of eBird to fulﬁll this function. Others have recognized that eBird provided substantial efﬁciencies for tasks that would otherwise require considerable additional coordi- nation and development overhead (Wiggins, 2012). 2.3. Improving data quality While the straightforward data collection protocols and partic- ipation incentives employed by eBird engage large numbers of par- ticipants, these protocols also produce data with higher levels of noise than data collected under more rigorous protocols. Several important sources of bias have been discussed in the literature including variation among observers (Cooper et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2010), ‘‘false absences’’ owing to imperfect detection of organisms (McClintock et al., 2010), and uneven distributions of data in space and time (Boakes et al., 2010; Chu and Dietterich, 2013). Some of this variation can be accounted for during data analysis, but other types of noise need to be identiﬁed and re- moved as part of the data assimilation process. In this section we review steps we have taken to improve the quality of data col- lected by eBird. eBird’s process for maintaining data quality is a developing example of human computation (the engagement of human intel- ligence in targeted, programmatic tasks (Law and Ahn, 2011)), which seeks to identify and use the complementary strengths of machine and human intelligence. We identify eBird’s combination of human and machine intelligence as a Human/Computer Learn- ing Network (Kelling et al., 2013), with feedback between humans and computers allowing continued improvements in quality con- trol. eBird uses a two-part approach to quality control during data entry: automated ﬁlters and a growing network of regional editors. Automated data quality ﬁlters ﬂag records for review based on observation date and geographic location. This process provides the user with immediate feedback during checklist submission, allowing the user to correct typographical errors or reconsider a gi- ven species’ identiﬁcation. Once a ﬂagged entry is conﬁrmed as legitimate by the observer, a regional expert reviews the record, communicating with the observer to acquire and vet supporting documentation. Reviewers provide active feedback to participants on everything from bird identiﬁcation to best practices for eBird data collection. This relationship between reviewers and partici- pants leads to increased participant skill, thereby generating more useful data for analysis (Sullivan et al., 2009). The spatial and temporal resolution of the automated ﬁlters has become continually ﬁner since eBird’s inception, and eBird is now moving toward a data-driven approach to creating ﬁlters. Using existing data to identify threshold dates and counts that would be considered unusual for each species, we are creating more accurate spatial and temporal ﬁlters for vetting incoming checklist submissions. We further improve these ﬁlters by pro- viding a tool that allows expert regional editors to ﬁne-tune the frequency thresholds generated by this ‘‘emergent ﬁlter’’ process (Kelling, 2011). This combined process has reduced the workload for volunteer expert reviewers by decreasing the number of inap- propriately ﬂagged records, and improves the end-user experi- ence during data submission by providing more accurate feedback on what constitutes an unexpected species or unusually high count. 3. Access to eBird data Successful citizen science does not end at data collection; data management and delivery are also critical. eBird data are maintained in a highly managed centralized data infrastructure that serves as a benchmark among citizen-science programs (Kelling, 2011). A core principle of eBird is providing free and open access to data for a broad spectrum of data consumers. This diversity of users and uses of eBird data requires that we develop and curate multiple eBird data products to meet the speciﬁc needs of varied audiences. Two of these data products are based on the core data ﬁelds within the eBird database. Two additional eBird data products provide access to eBird data integrated with supplemental environmental data geared to- ward analysis and modeling. 3.1. eBird data access policy A growing number of biodiversity databases and database clear- inghouses provide access to data. However, proper attribution and acknowledgment for data providers is often lacking both by the clearinghouses as well as end-users. This issue led us to institute a new data access policy for eBird. Beginning in November 2012, we required anyone interested in downloading certain eBird data products to register with eBird. While eBird data are free, we re- quire registration in order (1) to encourage communication be- tween potential users and eBird staff, (2) to provide the Cornell Lab of Ornithology with metrics that allow analysis of data usage trends, (3) to improve data products, and (4) to create a method by which users can attest that eBird data will not be misused or added to commercial products. Data users must agree to the eBird terms of use policy, provide their name, country of residence, iden- tify their project type, provide the title of their project and an ab- stract, as well as their afﬁliation. These requests are individually reviewed to ensure validity, after which a data access key is granted. Once registered, users can access a series of online tools that allow queries to be written against the database to extract tar- get datasets. eBird data are bundled with our terms of use policy, metadata descriptors, and recommended citations. 34 B.L. Sullivan et al. / Biological Conservation 169 (2014) 31–40 3.2. Core eBird data products The eBird observational dataset (EOD) contains primary species occurrence data deﬁned as a record of a particular taxon in a par- ticular place at a particular point in time (Soberon and Peterson, 2009). eBird data consisting of location, date, and species are pro- vided in the EOD to ensure that they can be integrated with other observational data and natural history collections data for estimat- ing patterns in biodiversity (Jetz et al., 2012). The EOD is updated annually and is freely accessible via DataONE (dataone.org), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (gbif.org), the Avian Knowledge Network (avianknowledge.net), and VertNet (vert- net.org). The 2012 version contains more than 100 million bird observation records. Although data usage reports of the EOD are not provided by these data clearinghouses, EOD data from GBIF are used in other initiatives such as the NSF funded Lifemapper Project (lifemapper.org), and the United States Geological Survey’s Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) facility (biso- n.usgs.ornl.gov), and use of the EOD in ecological studies is wide- spread (e.g., Klicka et al., 2011; Lait et al., 2012; Davis et al., 2013). The eBird basic dataset (EBD) contains data in the form of checklists: counts of all bird species observed during a single search event (Sullivan et al., 2009). The EBD contains counts of spe- cies detected, the location where the search took place, the time the search was initiated, and the duration and length of the search. One value of grouping species within sets checklists in the EBD is the ability to identify associations between species. The EBD is up- dated quarterly and is available on the eBird website. As of August 2013 the EBD contained 134 million observation records. 3.3. Value-added eBird data products Many ecological and conservation problems require compre- hensive, high-resolution information about the spatial and tempo- ral distribution of populations. This poses a challenge because species observation data are often sparsely and irregularly distrib- uted, especially for widely distributed species. To address this chal- lenge, species distribution models are used to estimate species’ distributions in unobserved locations and times. In this section we describe two ‘‘value-added’’ eBird data products used for spe- cies distribution modeling and analysis. The eBird reference dataset (ERD) consists of the EBD with two additional types of information: species absence information and a suite of variables that describe the local environment. Species ab- sence information is included to facilitate the control of biases associated with the imperfect detection of birds. The importance of controlling for biases in detection with wildlife survey data is well known (MacKenzie et al., 2006), and is typically dependent on knowing when a species was observed as well as when it was not observed. By limiting the ERD to the set of checklists where participants conﬁrmed that they were reporting all species identi- ﬁed, zero counts can be included for unreported species. These zeros are sometimes referred to as ‘‘pseudo-absences’’ and indicate a lack of detection or identiﬁcation. The pseudo-absences are valu- able because they convey partial information about absence, which can be combined with participant-recorded information on search effort to capture and control for sources of variation associated with the detection process. The second set of variables included in the ERD describes the local environment where searches took place (e.g., landcover and climate). This information is provided to link species’ distributions to the environments on which they depend. The ERD is updated annually, covers the western hemi- sphere, and contains 89 million observations. The ERD is available via the eBird web site. By relating environmental predictors to observed occurrences, species distribution models can make predictions at unsampled locations and times. Elith and Leathwick (2009) provide a good review of the literature on species distribution models, using con- ventional analytical methods. Our early work with such methods revealed that they were not able to consistently produce accurate distribution models, and the creation of novel analytical tech- niques (Spatio-Temporal Exploratory Models (STEM); Fink et al., 2010, 2013) has led to an extensive engagement of statisticians and computer scientists in the eBird project. The resultant STEM models currently provide seasonal estimates of species’ distribu- tions across the contiguous U.S. for more than 300 species. For each species the probability of occurrence is estimated for each week of the year based on local landcover characteristics at approximately 1 million locations selected from a stratiﬁed ran- dom design. In addition, the STEM distribution occurrence estimates are ‘‘adjusted’’ to control for variation in detectability associated with search effort. By relating predictors that describe the detection process (e.g., search effort) to observed occurrences, species distri- bution models can control for these confounding sources of varia- tion (e.g., Link and Sauer, 1999; Lele et al., 2012). To facilitate this analysis, the ERD dataset only includes checklists where users re- ported effort variables: search time, transect length, time of day, number of observers, and protocol type. These variables are used to adjust the distribution estimates so that they represent a survey with constant effort; speciﬁcally, by estimating the probability that a typical eBird participant will detect the species on a search from 7 to 8AM while traveling 1 km on the given day at the given location. The model-based distributional estimates from STEM provide a good source of population-level distributional data for further studies. Visualizations for many species are available on the eBird website (ebird.org/plone/ebird/about/occurrence-maps). The STEM model distributional data are available through collaboration and partnership with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. In the future, the geographic scope of these distributional models will expand beyond the contiguous U.S. 4. Diverse uses of eBird data By combining the strengths and motivation of volunteer observers with computer technologies, the eBird project is gener- ating biodiversity data for an increasing variety of uses. In the past decade, more than 90 peer-reviewed publications either used eBird data or studied aspects of the eBird project. Over the past year, more than 1100 individuals from 40 countries have re- quested eBird data, making more than 3400 downloads repre- senting ca. 2.6 terabytes of data. Data users were classiﬁed into four broad categories (Fig. 3a). Almost 50% of requests came from individuals, self-categorized as academic or student, who were looking for datasets for research projects. While most of these students were studying species distribution, a signiﬁcant number were using the eBird data to support projects in GIS, statistics, or computer science (Fig. 3b). Many NGO/governmental users were using eBird data for estimating species occurrences on both pub- lic and private landholdings. Members of the general public mostly use eBird data to explore bird occurrences in their region of interest (i.e., general use), while commercial users were doing environmental impact statements for local or regional governments. Such broad data use is a major part of eBird’s success, and it in- spires participation in the project, both from the birding and re- search communities. In this section we discuss how data are being used within four key communities, and how collaboration and communications with these groups are further improving both collection and use of the data. B.L. Sullivan et al. / Biological Conservation 169 (2014) 31–40 35 4.1. Advancing computational methods Key to the eBird enterprise is the diverse research group that is actively forming around it. Consisting of scientists from a wide array of backgrounds, the research conducted by this group has im- proved eBird in numerous ways, ranging from the development of robust data products, to techniques for detecting and accounting for sampling bias, to helping eBird’s project leaders inform partic- ipants on data entry best practices, and how to increase the research value of the data. The increasing need for sophisticated statistical models and computational techniques that integrate, interpret, and analyze these vast data resources has led the eBird research group to pur- sue several data-intensive research challenges. Unique challenges associated with analyzing eBird data have led to innovations in machine-learning and statistics (Sorokina et al., 2007; Sheldon, 2010; Fink et al., 2010, 2013; Hutchinson et al., 2011). Novel ap- proaches to species distribution modeling (Fink et al., 2010, 2013) resulted in the creation of two of eBird’s data products: the eBird Reference Data Set, and the eBird Spatio-Temporal Exploratory Models. In addition, research extending the standard ‘‘Occupancy and Detection’’ species distribution model (MacKenzie et al., 2002) has improved our understanding of participant obser- vational skills (Hutchinson et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2010). This, in turn, will improve accuracy and analytical power in all ﬁelds where citizen-science or expertise-based information is used, especially in ecology, eco-informatics, and computational sustainability. 4.2. Increasing understanding of avian migration ecology eBird provides unique opportunities to investigate questions in western hemisphere avian ecology with unprecedented spatial and temporal detail (Hochachka and Fink, 2012). One area to which eBird is particularly well suited is the study of migration ecology for medium- and long-distance migrants. Typically, only the move- ments of individual birds in migration have been studied using band returns or, more recently, tracking devices (Bairlein, 2003). eBird provides the opportunity to study avian migration from a population-level perspective with a comprehensive spatial and temporal representation of migration of entire populations rather than individuals. For example, we can now quantify migration pat- terns and speeds at the population-level for many species across their annual cycles (Fig. 4). This has allowed for the testing of key predictions originating from optimal migration theory (La Sorte et al., 2013) and, for the ﬁrst time, has allowed us to quantify the structure, seasonal dynamics, and determinants of migration ﬂyways (La Sorte et al., Submitted for publication). In total, eBird is providing opportunities for major advances in how we under- stand and study the ecology and evolution of avian migration. As many populations of long-distance migratory species are declining (Robbins et al., 1989; Sanderson et al., 2006), this work also sup- ports modeling and mitigation efforts that are addressing the long-term implications of global climate change for migratory birds (La Sorte and Jetz, 2010). 4.3. Informing conservation policy and action The North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI) part- nership has produced a series of comprehensive analyses of the state of the birds for the United States (stateofthebirds.org). Be- cause of the recognition that bird populations are useful indicators of ecological health and biodiversity status (Pereira and Cooper, 2006; Lawton et al., 1998; Butchart et al., 2010), these reports have broad signiﬁcance for national conservation planning. The two re- cent State of the Birds reports used USGS-GAP’s Protected Areas Database of the U.S. (PAD-US) and eBird (i.e., EOD and STEM data) to estimate the stewardship responsibilities for bird populations on both public and private lands (U.S. NABCI, 2011, 2013). A long-standing challenge in bird conservation has been the dif- ﬁculty of studying complete annual cycles for any bird species that undergoes broad-scale and complex geographic movements. The rich spatial and temporal detail of eBird is beginning to break this barrier, facilitating analyses that provide information across large components of species’ annual cycles. For example, the use of eBird STEM with the US Protected Areas Database provided the opportu- nity to estimate weekly stewardship responsibilities for 370 spe- cies on public and private lands within the contiguous U.S. By combining these data, La Sorte et al. (Submitted for publication) identiﬁed species that moved seasonally between lands under dif- ferent public ownership, which provides a compelling rationale for inter-agency cooperation to develop full life-cycle conservation plans for birds. In partnership with The Nature Conservancy of California, we are currently summarizing information needed to identify season- ally varying priority conservation areas for target species of migra- tory birds, in order to design effective conservation strategies. California’s Central Valley is one of the most altered landscapes in the world, with only 5% of the former extent of 4 million acres of wetlands remaining (Hoekstra et al., 2005). Nevertheless the ref- uges, managed wetlands, and compatible agricultural lands in the A B Fig. 3. eBird data use based on 1100 data requests. Understanding the data user community is key in developing an effective citizen-science project, and delivering useful data for research and conservation. Feedback from these users helps shape development of eBird data products. 36 B.L. Sullivan et al. / Biological Conservation 169 (2014) 31–40 region still support millions of migrating and wintering waterfowl and shorebirds of the Paciﬁc Flyway (Western Hemisphere Shore- bird Reserve Network, 2003; Central Valley Joint Venture, 2006). In a region prone to drought, changing land uses, and water allocation disputes, speciﬁc and actionable recommendations for annual and long-term habitat management and water allocation are critical. The Nature Conservancy’s goal is to use STEM models to identify high value areas for birds, and then work with landowners and managers to better manage these key sites for water birds. Already, this work has led to the creation of effective conservation ease- ments, habitat management programs, and metrics for habitat credit trading and mitigation programs. 4.4. Education: student investigations with eBird Science education initiatives, from grade school through under- graduate levels, call for students to pose scientiﬁc questions, de- sign investigations, analyze data, and interpret the results. eBird ﬁts well with this mandate, and students and educators use eBird in classroom and independent projects ranging from ornithology to statistics (Fee and Trautmann, 2012; Trautmann et al., 2012; Traut- mann and McLinn, 2012). Accompanying curriculum resources have been created to support teachers in facilitating student inves- tigations (Schaus et al., 2007; Fee et al., 2011, 2013). Before or after observing local birds, students can use eBird data to determine which species are common in their community, discover trends, and develop hypotheses. Whether using their own bird observa- tions or looking for patterns in online data collected by others, stu- dents can pose research questions and conduct investigations addressing questions of their choice. In this era of big data, eBird gives students the opportunity to envision research beyond stereo- typical images of individual scientists working in the lab or ﬁeld. Using the animated ‘‘occurrence maps’’ that model migration dynamics, they see visually striking evidence for the relevance of citizen science in determining species-speciﬁc habitat require- ments throughout the year (Fee, 2013). Such use of online data visualization tools is a natural ﬁt for today’s students, most of whom have grown up using a wide range of digital applications in their daily lives and will rely on them increasingly throughout their careers. 5. The future We anticipate a series of key future developments that will help all facets of the eBird enterprise continue to evolve. 5.1. Making global connections—Tringa We envision a global bird monitoring network that engages the interests of birders across countries and cultures. To achieve this requires signiﬁcant investment in international partnership-build- ing, leveraging the knowledge and relationships of partners to help develop critical community engagement. While eBird’s tools are available worldwide, adoption in many regions has been marginal. In some cases, other citizen-engagement projects are already in place, with local institutions and birders already doing an excellent job collecting data. In many cases, however, these systems are idi- osyncratic and regionalized. Some only track information on resi- dent birds, or on migratory species during certain times of the year. The data from all of these local observational data systems could, in theory, be brought together under a common framework so that data can be shared and used for conservation efforts at glo- bal scales. To this end, a new initiative is underway called ‘‘Tringa’’ (named after a genus of shorebird that occurs worldwide), in- tended to leverage the data collecting and outreach capabilities of organizations around the world by making all existing data available within a common data framework. The concept is cur- rently being tested through collaboration between Cornell Lab of Ornithology with its eBird project, and the British Trust for Orni- thology who runs a comparable project in the United Kingdom called BirdTrack (blx1.bto.org/birdtrack/main/data-home.jsp). Our hope is that as Tringa evolves, more partners will join from around the world, expanding the coverage of the shared database. Fig. 4. STEM species distribution model for Purple Finch (Haemorhous purpureus) based on ERD data. Darker red indicates higher probability of ﬁnding a Purple Finch (Max = 80%). Note population-level differences in migration, with the eastern/boreal population (H. p. purpureus) migrating and wintering through the East and Southeast, whereas the western population (H. p. californicus) is largely resident, showing little seasonal change in distribution.

Sullivan et al. / Biological Conservation 169 (2014) 31–40 37 5.2. Community engagement through tool development eBird’s tools thus far have been developed to serve a largely North American audience, but with increasing use around the world, we must shift and adapt our development to engage com- munities that have different interests and goals. For example, the advent of inexpensive, high-resolution digital cameras has enabled a new generation of nature enthusiasts to experience birds in ways never before possible. We believe that eBird must build the part- nerships required to engage these existing communities, as well as develop its own tools to allow participants to store and share rich media. The Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds (macaulayli- brary.org/) has a long history of careful curation of rich media, and serves as a permanent archive for millions of sounds, videos, and photos. By leveraging new technology and the curatorial capacity and standards of the Macaulay Library, eBird will soon be a massive conduit for the collection and sharing of rich media. eBird relies on participants to identify birds correctly, but for most people, identifying birds is at times challenging. Thousands of species must be considered, and most reference materials re- quire knowledge of speciﬁc terminology in order to be helpful. ‘‘Merlin’’ (beta URL: allaboutbirds.org/labs) is an online bird iden- tiﬁcation tool that is being developed to lower the barrier to bird identiﬁcation for a broad audience. Merlin asks the user a series of simple questions including the location, date, color, and size of an unknown bird. By combining date- and place-speciﬁc eBird data and crowd-sourced compilations of information on how people de- scribe birds, with machine learning analytical techniques, Merlin computes a list of likely matches and presents the list to the user. eBird data serves as the backbone for Merlin, enabling it to calcu- late the probability of species occurrence at locations across North America, each day of the year. 5.3. Novel insights from analysis Effective conservation requires understanding the needs of birds throughout their full annual cycles, which is particularly challenging for species that require separate breeding and non-breeding grounds and are dependent on migratory stopover locations (Hagan and Johnston, 1992). Migration and winter repre- sent a large proportion of many species’ lives, yet we still know remarkably little about birds’ requirements during these critical phases of the annual cycle. eBird data and models are showing when and where species occur throughout the western hemi- sphere, revealing population-level movements and habitat associ- ations of birds across their full annual cycles (Fig. 5). Importantly, these models will also reveal how habitat use changes through space and time. A current focus of ours is development of analytical methods for accurately estimating species abundance across space and time from eBird data, not simply modeling probabilities of occurrence. As with our work to model bird occurrences, we need to evaluate, adapt, and extend existing approaches for abundance modeling (e.g., Royle and Dorazio, 2008; Sauer and Link, 2011) in order to deal with the issue of non-stationarity of associations through space and time, and to ensure that analyses can be run with limited human intervention. We can assume that, in general, a species that is more abundant is more likely to be seen and reported, but the nature, variability, and species-speciﬁc nuances of that relation- ship are unclear. For species that occur in large aggregations, describing ﬁne-scale variation in abundance is critical for effective conservation. Even less dramatic variation in abundance can go undetected in analyses of data describing occurrence. For example, if a resident species’ abundance at a particular location increases, perhaps as the result of an irruption (e.g., Black-capped Chickadee (Poecile atricapillus)), or decreases as a result of an emerging disease (e.g., Mycoplasma gallisepticum in House Finches (Haemor- hous mexicanus)(Hochachka and Dhondt, 2000)), current analyses of eBird data will not effectively show this. Estimating abundance across large parts of the globe, throughout the year, will allow for increased application of eBird data for research and conservation. Knowledge of migratory behavior is critical for studying the ecology and evolution of bird movements (Greenberg and Marra, 2005; Salewski and Bruderer, 2007). This information can be used in applying best conservation practices for migratory birds. A new research project called BirdCast (birdcast.info) is unifying eBird and weather surveillance radar data to predict the species compo- sition, timing, magnitude, speed, and direction of bird movements across the continental US. By leveraging innovative machine-learn- ing techniques to develop models to identify complex conditions governing the dynamics of migration behavior, choice of migratory pathways, factors that inﬂuence when birds migrate, and the speed and duration of nocturnal movements, BirdCast has the potential to transform our understanding of population-level bird move- ments at the continental scale (Sheldon et al., 2013). Global climate change, land conversion, globalization, and hu- man population growth are presenting signiﬁcant conservation challenges that require understanding processes that occur at con- tinental and global scales. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of these processes requires the ability to monitor systems across full annual cycles in near real-time to identify current and impending threats, as well as to evaluate the outcomes of conservation ac- tions. However, scientiﬁc and conservation communities remain limited by the challenge of collecting the data required to simulta- neously support inference and action at multiple spatial and tem- poral scales. For terrestrial ecological communities at least, eBird is well poised to provide a solution. Some of the most compelling information on the implications of global change for biodiversity has come from the analysis of citizen-science data. For example, data compiled on birds (Hurlbert and Liang, 2012; La Sorte and Jetz, 2012; Monahan and Tingley, 2012) and butterﬂies (Breed et al., 2013) by citizen scientists in North America have been used to identify the biological consequences of climate change. Manage- ment agencies and conservation organizations are beginning to Fig. 5. Preliminary AdaSTEM species distribution model for Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) during fall migration across the western hemisphere. eBird’s broad spatial and temporal scale allow modeling species across the complete life cycle. Importantly, these models also analyze species-habitat relationships that change through space and time. 38 B.L. Sullivan et al. / Biological Conservation 169 (2014) 31–40 recognize that eBird provides invaluable year-round data on spe- cies distributions and abundance, at range-wide scales, but also with ﬁne spatial and temporal resolution. eBird’s importance for providing these data as a component of full life-cycle conservation planning will grow. Expanding the data-delivery capacity of the eBird enterprise to meet these demands will be our primary focus over the next decade. 6. Conclusion Citizen science has the potential to transform our understand- ing of many ecological processes. For studies of avian ecology, data from citizen-science projects offer the ability to test hypotheses at spatial and temporal scales never before possible. Due to their pop- ularity, birds lend themselves to this approach perhaps better than any other organism. However, in order to be successful, careful attention must be paid to all aspects of the project, from data col- lection to data delivery and use. In this paper we describe three key aspects for developing a successful citizen science project: striking a balance between data quantity and quality, facilitating wide use of the data by developing and delivering data products, and engag- ing a diverse array of collaborators in all aspects of the project. We have illustrated these points by describing the eBird enterprise, which over its ﬁrst decade has demonstrated success in gathering vast amounts of avian biodiversity data that are now being used across many scientiﬁc disciplines.
