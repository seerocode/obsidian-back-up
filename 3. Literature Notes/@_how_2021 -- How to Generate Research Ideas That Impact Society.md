**How to Generate Research Ideas That Impact Society**
[_how_2021](zotero://select/items/@_how_2021)


### Abstract: 
Focusing only on scientific advancement keeps us from addressing the kinds of problems that motivated us to pursue science in the first place, write Adam Seth Levine and J. Nathan Matias.

### TL;DR
When thinking about research topics that have societal impact, ask: _“With whom should I speak about the problems I care about?”_. Follow the suggested steps to schedule conversations with those stakeholders, understand what their needs are, and explore ideas that reveal a gap in the literature and could help those communities. 

### Summary 
**Collaborative conversation** -- initiating one or more collaborative conversations with practitioners, community leaders and/or policy makers. 

Here are three ways collaborative conversation helps research:

1. Reveal new ideas. For example, political scientists’ idea to study the impact of social pressure on voting came from a [conversation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-010-9120-2) with a campaigner in Michigan. That practitioner had noticed that the threat of public exposure from not voting might increase turnout.
2.  Reveal limitations in the existing scientific literature.
3.  [Keep scientific theory grounded](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00239.x?casa_token=GMcUsP4550UAAAAA:n_x0T7ynPNPAtnEfFJFVF7B0YGVi56Aq9oz5KLv3Ipa-cCxybqpgCd99KbrD0nzfYPxkKedP_XA40ZQ) on why we decide to pursue a graduate degree in the first place.

### Notes from Zotero:
When thinking about research topics that have societal impact, ask: <i>“With whom should I speak about the problems I care about?”</i> 

Collaborative conversation - initiating one or more collaborative conversations with practitioners, community leaders and/or policy makers. Here are three ways collaborative conversation helps research: 

<ol> <li>Reveal new ideas. For example, political scientists’ idea to study the impact of social pressure on voting came from a https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-010-9120-2 with a campaigner in Michigan. That practitioner had noticed that the threat of public exposure from not voting might increase turnout. <li>Reveal limitations in the existing scientific literature. <li>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00239.x?casa_token=GMcUsP4550UAAAAA:n_x0T7ynPNPAtnEfFJFVF7B0YGVi56Aq9oz5KLv3Ipa-cCxybqpgCd99KbrD0nzfYPxkKedP_XA40ZQ on why we decide to pursue a graduate degree in the first place. (“Remember your why”) </ol> 

Five Steps for Collaborative Conversation 

<ol> <li>Figure out what real-world problems you are trying to solve and why you care about them. <li>Identify stakeholders in communities who are working to address, or who are affected by, these problems. <li><b>Reach out to those stakeholders directly with a short, clear ask…</b>Adopt a benefit-exchange mind-set, focusing on why the person whom you’ve contacted might benefit from interacting with you and vice versa. In the initial ask, briefly describe the problem you care about, identify shared values, state your desire to learn from the individual and include a sentence or two about your task-related expertise. <li><b>Focus on https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/asap.12204?casa_token=5eICQaTP9MMAAAAA%3AkyZ1v7_sX3EKwybggFu7g6w_PIGyFDsbUVbkXm05MnfIbMDQ_S6uCyPxtee451sh9vEFaBsLgPZeFQ and show awareness of the boundaries of your own knowledge to make the conversation <i>collaborative</i>.</b> In addition, plan to follow up, either immediately or once your research is complete. <li><b>Know your field. </b>Take what you learn from the conversation and connect it to relevant questions that other scientists are asking. Read examples of https://www.worldcat.org/title/pasteurs-quadrant-basic-science-and-technological-innovation/oclc/489943896 and decide whether or not it makes sense to formally partner with a practitioner to conduct your work. </ol>
